(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d) for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cUncertificated Shares\u201d). The Exchange Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Exchange Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than two Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and finalized prior to the Effective Time and which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.   (b)          Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably acceptable to Parent, or (ii) receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.   (c)          If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)          After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this \u200b\u200bArticle 2.   \n\n\n18    \n\n\n  (e)          Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to \u200b\u200bSection 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this \u200b\u200bSection 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock without any interest thereon.   Section 2.04.      Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding \u200bSection 2.02, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.   Section 2.05.      Treatment of Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each award of, or with respect to, Company Common Stock that is subject to vesting or other forfeiture conditions (including any restricted stock unit awards but other than a Company Option) (each, a \u201cCompany RSA\u201d) that is outstanding and unvested under a Company Stock Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company RSA, become fully vested and shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSA (and then adding, if applicable, the value of any dividends accrued with respect to such Company RSA as of the Effective Time). With respect to each Company RSA for which the number of shares of Company Common Stock deliverable under such award is determined based on the satisfaction of performance conditions (each, a \u201cCompany PSA\u201d), such performance conditions shall be deemed to have been earned at the greater of (A) the target amount under the terms of the award agreement relating to such award and (B) the amount reasonably projected to be earned under the terms of the award agreement based on performance achievement through the Effective Time.   \n\n\n19    \n\n\n  (b)           At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cCompany Option\u201d) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company Option, become fully vested and shall be automatically canceled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in respect of such fully vested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall automatically be forfeited and canceled without consideration, effective as of the Effective Time.   (c)           With respect to Company Options that were intended to qualify as \u201cincentive stock options\u201d (\u201cIncentive Stock Options\u201d) within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall without any action on the part of the holder of such Incentive Stock Option, fully vest such Incentive Stock Options and each holder of Incentive Stock Options shall be provided with written notice that such holder shall, during the period beginning on the date of such notice and ending on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the \u201cExercise Period\u201d), have the right to exercise such Incentive Stock Option by providing the Company with a notice of exercise and a cash amount equal to the applicable exercise price. In the event that a holder of an Incentive Stock Option elects to exercise his or her Incentive Stock Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to this \u200bSection 2.05(c), such Incentive Stock Option (or any portion thereof) shall be deemed to be exercised as of prior to the Closing with such holder receiving in exchange a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the portion of such Incentive Stock Option that such holder elected to exercise immediately prior to the Closing and such shares of Company Common Stock will be treated in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\naccordance with \u200bSection 2.02(a). Each Incentive Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is not exercised during the Exercise Period and remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with \u200bSection 2.05(b).   (d)           All payments under \u200bSection 2.05(a) and \u200bSection 2.05(b) in respect of Company RSAs and Company Options, respectively, shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with the Company\u2019s or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any required withholding Taxes.   (e)            The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this \u200bSection 2.05 and to terminate the Company Stock Plans, effective as of the Effective Time, such that, following the Effective Time there shall be no outstanding Company RSAs, Company PSAs or Company Options (whether vested or unvested).   \n\n\n20    \n\n\n  Section 2.06.     Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from the vesting of any Company RSAs or Company PSAs or exercise of Company Options, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.   Section 2.07.     Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this \u200b\u200bArticle 2.   Section 2.08.     Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Merger Sub, and any other applicable payor shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   Section 2.09.     No Dividends. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Date will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.   Section 2.10.     Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.   \n\n\n21    \n\n\n  ARTICLE 3 The Surviving Corporation   Section 3.01.     Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to \u200bSection 7.02(b), the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other parties of any substantive communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the other parties or their outside counsel to review in advance any proposed material written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or antitrust matters in connection with this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby unless in each case it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other parties or their outside counsel with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to any Competition Laws or Foreign Investment Laws in connection with this Agreement; provided that such material may be designated as restricted to \u201coutside counsel\u201d or redacted as described in \u200bSection 8.01(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications and strategy for (1) preparing and filing with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party any documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents, (2) obtaining and maintaining any approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority, or (3) defending any action, suit or proceeding challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the HSR Act and any other Applicable Law (including Competition Law).   \n\n\n 66     \n\n\n  Section 8.02.

If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each of the Company and Parent.   \n\n\n 67     \n\n\n  Section 8.03.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of any press release or the making of any public statement with respect to which the foregoing consultation procedures have been followed, either party may issue such additional publications or press releases and make such other customary announcements without consulting with any other party hereto so long as such additional publications, press releases and announcements do not disclose any non-public information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of the disclosure included in and as materially consistent with, the press release or public statement with respect to which the other party had been consulted.   Section 8.04.          Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders.

Section 8.07.          Litigation and Proceedings. The Company shall control the defense or settlement of any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding in connection with, or arising out of or otherwise related to a demand for dissenters\u2019 rights under Applicable Law which shall be governed by \u200bSection 2.04) against the Company or any of its directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (\u201cTransaction Litigation\u201d); provided that the Company shall (a) give Parent prompt written notice of any Transaction Litigation, including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto, (b) give Parent reasonable opportunity to participate, at Parent\u2019s expense, in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation, and (c) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and provided, further, that the Company agrees that it shall not settle, or offer to settle, any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Annex I or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties\u201d.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with the Company being the surviving entity, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d);   WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or, such shares, \u201cCompany Shares\u201d) are entering support agreements with Parent in the form of Exhibit A (the \u201cSupport Agreements\u201d) simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the \u201cCompany Board of Directors\u201d) has (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the \u201cTransactions\u201d), including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Shares vote to approve the adoption of this Agreement (such recommendation, the \u201cCompany Board Recommendation\u201d); and   WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective stockholders.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:   \n\n\n    \n\n\n  ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1.          The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 1.2.          Closing. The closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d) shall take place as soon as practicable, but in any event no later three (3) business days, following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Morrison & Foerster LLP, 425 Market Street, San Francisco CA 94105, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the \u201cClosing Date\u201d.   Section 1.3.          Effective Time.   (a)               Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d) with respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the \u201cSecretary of State\u201d), as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such later date and time as is agreed between the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being referred to herein as the \u201cEffective Time\u201d).   (b)               The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties, of the Company and Merger Sub, as provided under the applicable sections of the DGCL.   ARTICLE II    SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 2.1.          Governing Documents. Subject to Section 7.5, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws.   Section 2.2.          Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation.   (a)               From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)               From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   \n\n\n-2-   \n\n\n  ARTICLE III \n\n\nTREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 3.1.          Treatment of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a)               Conversion of Company Securities. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company Restricted Stock but not including Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $9.25 in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). As of the Effective Time, the holders of certificates (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) or book-entry shares (\u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Shares (including Company Restricted Stock but not including the Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.   (b)               Cancellation of Company Common Stock. Each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock (or by any wholly owned subsidiary thereof) or held by Parent or Merger Sub (or by any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such Company Shares collectively, the \u201cCancelled Shares\u201d).   (c)               Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (d)               Adjustment to Merger Consideration. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Company Shares shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), division or subdivision of shares or other similar transaction, or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.   Section 3.2.          Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.    (a)               Exchange Fund. Prior to Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the funds to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to the Merger. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or promptly following the Effective Time and on the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) all of the funds necessary to make the aggregate payments of the Merger Consideration due under Section 3.1 (the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 3.2(c), except as expressly provided for in this Agreement; provided that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to the Exchange Fund shall be the property of Parent.   (b)               Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than the third (3rd) business day) following the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nEffective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing Company Shares that pursuant to Section 3.1(a) were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time may reasonably specify, and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration into which the number of Company Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.   \n\n\n-3-   \n\n\n  (c)               Payment Procedures. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavit of loss and compliance with such other requirements in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Company Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2(c), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (d)               Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided herein. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   (e)               Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent\u2019s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and in compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f)                Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, and subject to such holder\u2019s compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) (other than the surrender of a Certificate), the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1.   \n\n\n-4-   \n\n\n  Section 3.3.          Dissenter\u2019s Rights.   (a)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\u2019s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\u2019s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Company Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificates formerly representing such Company Shares or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be.   (b)               The Company shall give prompt (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any such appraisal demands. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) with respect to Company Shares that become Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand therefor.   Section 3.4.          Treatment of Company Equity Awards.   (a)               At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (the \u201cCompany Restricted Stock\u201d) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent such Company Restricted Stock would not otherwise vest) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and be treated in the same manner as all other Company Shares for such purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (b)               Each option to purchase Company Shares (other than rights to purchase Company Shares under the Company ESPP), whether vested or unvested and whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cCompany Option\u201d) shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company Option would not otherwise vest) and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share of such Company Option by (ii) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the amount described in this Section 3.4(b), if any. Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the second preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to such payment, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) calendar days) following the Effective Time. Any Company Option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.   (c)               Each award of restricted stock units denominated in Company Shares, whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cCompany RSU Award\u201d), shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company RSU Award would not otherwise vest) and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

The provisions under this Section 6.2(e)(ii) shall also apply with respect to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change of Recommendation (except that any reference to four (4) business days shall instead be three (3) business days); provided that, no such three (3) business day period shall be required if such three (3) business day period would commence within five (5) business days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting (taking into account any adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting required by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(1)) unless any such three (3) business day period is the first three (3) business day period under this Section 6.2(e)(ii) with respect to an Intervening Event (in which case such three (3) business day period shall commence).   \n\n\n-38-   \n\n\n  (f)                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) issuing a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e- 2(a), or making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company\u2019s stockholders if (with respect to this clause (ii) only) the Company Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 duties under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, any \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation; provided that this Section 6.2(f) shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation, except to the extent permitted by Section 6.2(d) or Section 6.2(e).   ARTICLE VII \n\n\nADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n Section 7.1.          Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting.   (a)               As promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than twenty (20) business days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, in consultation with Parent, and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 6.2, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its respective Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent further covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) on the date the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the holders of Company Shares, and on the date of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement), will (i) fail to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or (ii) contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading.

The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto (other than solely to the extent relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Recommendation), prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating them to the holders of Company Shares and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider any comments proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed at the earliest reasonably practicable date to the holders of Company Shares entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting (and in any event no later than twenty (20) calendar days before the date of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting), and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to Section 6.2) to obtain the necessary approval of the Merger by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon.   (c)               If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, will not contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and correct such information, and the Company shall file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC.   (d)               Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote (the \u201cCompany Stockholders\u2019 Meeting\u201d) with a record date and meeting date to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent, which meeting date shall be no later than thirty (30) business days after (i) the tenth calendar day after the preliminary Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC (or if such date is not a business day, the next succeeding business day) if by such date the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if by such tenth calendar day the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.2(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.   (e)               As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the reasonable request of Parent), the Company shall conduct a \u201cbroker search\u201d in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act.   \n\n\n-40-   \n\n\n  (f)                The Company shall (A) provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis and (B) give written notice to Parent one (1) day prior to the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting, and on the day of, but prior to the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained.   (g)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; provided that (1) if at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement, either the Company or Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite Company Vote is unlikely to be obtained at the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, then each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to require an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of this Agreement; provided, further, that no such single adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting by more than seven (7) calendar days from the prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding the Outside Date; and (2) the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting if (x) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting by applicable Law, or (y) the Company Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting in order to give the holders of Company Shares sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent or otherwise made available to such holders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise (in each case so long as any such information or disclosure was made in compliance with this Agreement); provided that the Company shall be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting pursuant to this clause (2) on no more than two (2) occasions and no such adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting by more than seven (7) calendar days from the prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding the Outside Date. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, (x) the Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting and (y) the only matters to be voted upon at the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting shall be the Requisite Company Vote and routine proposals required in connection with such vote (and not any other matters, including any Acquisition Proposal).   (h)               Parent shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries as of the record date of the Company Stockholders\u2019 Meeting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n Section 7.2.          Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this Section 7.2 to provide Parent or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices (provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty, including through clean team arrangements) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege).   \n\n\n-41-   \n\n\n  (b)               Parent will hold, and will cause its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2, in confidence subject to the disclosure and other use and other limitations under and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII or give rise to any right to terminate under Article IX.   Section 7.3.          Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a)               Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall cooperate with each other and use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries and other controlled affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, registrations, approvals, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.

Neither Party will directly or indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity related to this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   \n\n\n-42-   \n\n\n  (b)               Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.3(a) to obtain all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under any Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other Party, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions (other than Item \u201c4(c)\u201d and \u201c4(d)\u201d documents as those terms are used under the HSR Act); (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party (or its outside counsel) of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) or any other Governmental Entity, by promptly providing copies to the other Party (or its outside counsel) of any such written communications, and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (iii) permit the other Party (or its outside counsel) to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party (or its outside counsel) the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person, videoconference, or telephonic meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or other Person; provided, that materials required to be provided pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.3(a) and this Section 7.3(b), Parent shall, in its sole discretion, after, to the extent practicable, consultation with the Company and considering in good faith the view of the Company, (x) control all strategy to obtain all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under any Antitrust Law and (y) lead any communications that any party hereto engages with, or any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference that any party hereto has with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nother Person, with respect to the Transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to, and the Company shall not agree to, without Parent\u2019s prior written consent, (A) execute settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or with any other Person, (B) agree to sell, divest, license, or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset, business, property right, or product line of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (C) permit the Company to sell, divest, license, or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset, business, property right, or product line of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (D) agree to take any action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or ability to retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets, property rights, or product lines of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including (x) terminate existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (y) terminate any joint venture or other arrangement of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and (z) create any relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and (E) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, by consenting promptly to such action by the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Parent shall take any such action described in the foregoing sub-clauses (A) through (C), if and only if such action (1) is necessary to ensure that no Governmental Entity with the authority to clear, authorize, or otherwise approve the consummation of the Transactions, fails to do so by the Outside Date, (2) is not with respect to any product, product candidate or research program of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (3) would be immaterial to the combined business of Parent and the Surviving Corporation following the Closing.   \n\n\n-44-   \n\n\n  Section 7.4.          Publicity. Following the issuance of the initial joint press release with respect to the Transactions, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent shall, and neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of their respective Subsidiaries or authorize any of their Representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement in advance; provided, that (a) the Company shall not be required by this Section 7.4 to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that may be a Superior Proposal or a Change of Recommendation to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.2, (b) Parent shall not be required by this Section 7.4 to provide any such review or comment to the Company in connection with any response to a press release or other announcement permitted by clause (a), (c) the Parties shall not be required by this Section 7.4 to provide any such review or comment to the other Party in the event of any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement, and (d) each Party and their respective affiliates may make statements that are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section 7.4. Each of the Parties agrees that, promptly following execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall issue an initial joint press release with respect to the Transactions, in a form mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent and (ii) the Company shall file a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching such initial press release and copy of this Agreement as exhibits.

(a)               For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law; provided, that such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, in each case, in existence on the date of this Agreement or any indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement that is in existence on the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent or the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.5, the provisions of this Section 7.5 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.   \n\n\n-45-   \n\n\n  (b)               From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect, and shall fulfill and comply with (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and comply with) the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the organizational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ndocuments of any Company Subsidiary that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions).   (c)               Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for the Company\u2019s current directors and officers and all other Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance for liability for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the \u201cD&O Insurance\u201d). Such D&O Insurance must be no less favorable than the Company\u2019s existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid for the D&O Insurance prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute for the D&O Insurance a single premium tail coverage or extended reporting period with respect to the D&O Insurance currently in effect with an annual cost of such tail coverage or extended reporting period not in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid for the D&O Insurance prior to the date of this Agreement.   (d)               In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5. The rights and obligations under this Section 7.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.   \n\n\n-46-   \n\n\n    (e)               The Indemnified Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.5. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.5 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, contribution, exculpation or advancement of expenses that any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation, bylaw, contract or otherwise.   Section 7.6.          Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

(c)               Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 7.8 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\namendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).   (d)               If requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to terminate, or, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a multiple employer welfare arrangement, cease participation in, any broad-based Company Benefit Plan, to be effective (i) with respect to any plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any other Company Benefit Plans, no later than the Effective Time, or, with respect to with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a multiple employer welfare arrangement, the soonest date possible following the Closing Date, in each case, in accordance with terms of such plan, the participation agreement, if any, and applicable Law.

Upon the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MBCA and UBCA, AB will merge with and into GBCI, with GBCI as the surviving corporation, and in connection therewith, all shares of AB Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder of shares of AB Stock, be cancelled and extinguished and converted automatically into the right to receive in the aggregate the Total Merger Consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.3. Immediately following the Merger, pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement and as set forth in Section 1.7, the Bank will be merged with and into Glacier Bank, with Glacier Bank as the surviving bank. 1.2 Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, including Section 1.3 as of the Effective Date: \n\n\n1.2.1 Outstanding GBCI Common Stock. The shares of GBCI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain as issued and outstanding. \n\n\n1.2.2 Outstanding AB Stock. Each share of AB Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to receive from GBCI in accordance with Section 1.6 (a) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (b) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of GBCI Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.3. \n\n\n1.3 No Fractional Shares.

Such fractional share interests will not include the right to vote or receive dividends or any interest on dividends. 1.4 AB Stock Awards. \n\n\n1.4.1 Outstanding AB Options. The AB Options have been duly granted and remain outstanding pursuant to the AB Stock Plans. If any holder of an AB Option that may by its terms be exercised provides a notice of exercise of such AB Option to AB on or before the 15th calendar day prior to the Effective Date (such date, the \u201cOption Exercise Notice Deadline\u201d), AB shall issue shares of AB Stock upon such exercise in accordance with the terms of the AB Options and the applicable AB Stock Plan, including receipt of payment of the exercise price therefor, and each such share of AB Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.3 at the Effective Time. No exercise of AB Options shall be permitted if an option holder fails to provide notice of exercise to AB by the Option Exercise Notice Deadline. With respect to AB Options that remain outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time, such AB Options, whether vested or unvested at the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, shall be canceled, and in lieu thereof, the holders of such AB Options shall be paid in cash an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of AB Stock subject to such option at the Effective Time and (b) the amount by which the Total Consideration Value Per Share exceeds the exercise price per share of such AB Option, net of any cash which must be withheld under applicable federal and state income and employment tax Laws and regulations. As a condition to the receipt of a cash payment in cancellation of AB Options, each option holder shall if reasonably requested by GBCI execute a cancellation agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to GBCI. In the event that the exercise price of an AB Option (whether vested or unvested) outstanding at the Effective Time is greater than the Total Consideration Value Per Share, then automatically and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, at the Effective Time, such AB Option shall be canceled without any payment made in exchange therefor.   -11-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n1.4.2 Restricted Stock Units.

Such cash and evidence of the GBCI Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are referred to in this Agreement as the \u201cExchange Fund.\u201d To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full the amounts contemplated by this Section 1.5, GBCI shall promptly replace or restore such amounts so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by this Article 1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement. \n\n\n1.6 Certificates. \n\n\n1.6.1 Letter of Transmittal. GBCI will cause the Exchange Agent, within five Business Days following the Effective Date, to mail to each holder of record of a certificate evidencing shares of AB Stock (a \u201cCertificate\u201d) or evidence of a book-entry account statement relating to the ownership of shares of AB Stock (\u201cUncertificated Shares\u201d) a customary form letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.6.1) advising such holder of the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares for the consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this Agreement (\u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d). \n\n\n1.6.2 Payment Procedures. Each Certificate and Uncertificated Share will, from and after the Effective Time, be deemed for all corporate purposes to represent and evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (and cash for fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.3) owing in respect of the number of shares of AB Stock represented thereby. Following the Effective Time, (a) holders of Certificates will exchange their Certificates and, in accordance with instructions provided in the Letter of Transmittal, shall provide to the Exchange Agent a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal in order to effect the exchange of their Certificates, or (b) holders of Uncertificated Shares will provide to the Exchange Agent a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and transfer their Uncertificated Shares by an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d to the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in exchange for, (y) evidence of issuance in book entry form, or upon written request of such holder and appropriate payment therefor, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of GBCI Common Stock equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of AB Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, rounded down to the nearest whole number, and (z) cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, to which such holder is entitled in accordance with Section 1.3. Until such Certificate or \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and a properly executed Letter of Transmittal is received by the Exchange Agent (or, in the   -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ncase of a lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the procedure in Section 1.6.4 is complied with), the holder of AB Stock evidenced thereby will not be entitled to receive his, her or its Per Share Stock Consideration. \n\n\n1.6.3 Issuance of Certificates in Other Names. Any Person requesting that any certificate evidencing GBCI Shares be issued in a name other than the name in which the surrendered Certificate or Uncertificated Share is registered must: (a) establish to GBCI\u2019s satisfaction the right to receive the certificate evidencing GBCI Shares and (b) either pay to GBCI any applicable transfer or other Taxes or establish to GBCI\u2019s satisfaction that all applicable Taxes have been paid or are not required. \n\n\n1.6.4 Lost, Stolen, and Destroyed Certificates. With respect to a Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will be authorized to issue or pay the holder\u2019s Per Share Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.3 in exchange thereof, if the holder provides GBCI with: (a) satisfactory evidence in a reasonable form that the holder owns AB Stock and that the Certificate representing this ownership is lost, stolen, or destroyed, (b) any affidavit or security GBCI\u2019s transfer agent may require in accordance with its policies and procedures (including such bond as may be required by the Exchange Agent in accordance with such policies), and (c) any reasonable additional assurances that GBCI or the Exchange Agent may require. \n\n\n1.6.5 Rights to Dividends and Distributions. After the Effective Time, no holder of any Certificate will be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions otherwise payable to holders of record of GBCI Common Stock on any date on or after the Effective Date, unless the holder has surrendered in accordance with this Agreement his, her or its Certificates (or has met the requirements of Section 1.6.4) in exchange for certificates representing GBCI Shares or evidence of GBCI stock ownership. Surrender of Certificates will not deprive the holder of any dividends or distributions that the holder is entitled to receive as a record holder of AB Stock prior to the Effective Time. When the holder surrenders his, her or its Certificates in exchange for GBCI Shares, the holder shall become a shareholder of record of GBCI and shall receive the amount, without interest, of any cash dividends and any other distributions declared and distributed after the Effective Time on the whole number of GBCI Shares into which the holder\u2019s AB Stock was converted at the Effective Time. \n\n\n1.6.6 Checks in Other Names. Any Person requesting that a check for any cash payable pursuant to this Agreement be issued in a name other than the name in which the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange for the cash is registered must establish to GBCI\u2019s satisfaction the right to receive this cash. \n\n\n1.6.7 Undelivered Certificates. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by shareholders of AB on a date that is 12 months after the Effective Date may be returned to GBCI, at GBCI\u2019s election. To the extent so returned, holders of AB Stock who have not, prior to such time, complied with the provisions of this Section 1.6 will, from such time forward, look only to GBCI for payment of the Per Share Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares to which they are entitled and/or unpaid dividends and distributions on the GBCI Shares deliverable with respect to each share of AB Stock held by such holders as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest. Neither GBCI nor AB will be liable to any holder of AB Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of AB Stock, GBCI and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit the Per Share Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party with instructions to release the Per Share Stock Consideration as determined between the disputing parties promptly upon resolution of the dispute, and thereafter be relieved of any responsibility with respect to any claims thereto. \n\n\n1.7 Bank Merger.

Following execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, AB or the Bank, as applicable, shall: \n\n\n(a) Use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy any contractual notice or similar requirements under, and obtain any consents required by, the Material Contracts arising from the Transactions, or that will arise out of completion of the Transactions. \n\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and as permitted by applicable Law, effective at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) terminate by all necessary and appropriate actions of the boards of directors of AB and the Bank, as applicable, such Compensation Plans as may be reasonably requested by GBCI, including without limitation, as set forth on Schedule 4.1.3(b), after bringing all plan documents into compliance with all legislative and regulatory requirements that are effective upon the termination date of the Compensation Plans, and (ii) if requested by GBCI, cause benefit accruals and entitlements under such Compensation Plans to cease and cause the cancellation of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to any such Compensation Plan for such period as may be requested by GBCI.

AB and the Bank will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. AB agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will, and AB will direct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to initiate, solicit, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to shareholders of AB) with respect to an Acquisition Event (any such proposal or offer, an \u201cAcquisition Proposal\u201d) or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; except that, in the event AB receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and the board of directors of AB determines prior to approval of this Agreement and the Merger by AB\u2019s shareholders at the AB Meeting, in good faith and after consultation with independent legal counsel, that (a) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (b) fiduciary duties applicable to it require it to engage in negotiations with, provide confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with a Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, AB may do so to the extent the board of directors of AB determines it is required by its fiduciary duties. In such event, prior to providing any confidential information or data to any such Person, AB and such Person shall have executed a confidentiality agreement on terms at least as favorable to AB as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. AB will further notify GBCI in writing promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with AB, or if any such inquiry, proposal or request is thereafter materially modified or amended, including providing to GBCI the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or inquiry in connection with each required notice, together with a copy of any written proposals received (it being understood that the name of Person making the Acquisition Proposal may be redacted from the copy of the written proposal provided to GBCI). AB will take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate individuals or entities referred to in the second sentence of this Section 4.1.9 of the obligations to be undertaken in this Section 4.1.9. Nothing contained in this Section 4.1.9 shall prohibit AB or the board of directors of AB from complying with AB\u2019s obligations required under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the board of directors of AB\u2019s recommendation that AB\u2019s shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger unless the board of directors of AB reaffirms such recommendation in such disclosure. \n\n\n4.1.10 Status of Title. AB will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide GBCI, no later than 45 days after the Execution Date, lot book or similar reports for the Owned Real Estate issued by title insurance companies reasonably satisfactory to GBCI (the \u201cTitle Companies\u201d), the cost of which shall be paid by GBCI. Such reports shall show the current status of title to the Owned Real Estate. Within 30 days after the date on which AB delivers the foregoing reports to GBCI for its review, GBCI will inform AB in writing whether, and in what manner, it objects to any of the exceptions to title shown in any of the title reports (such notice, an \u201cObjection Notice\u201d). AB will, within 20 days of the date on which it receives a written Objection Notice from GBCI, inform GBCI if there are any objections that it is unable or unwilling to remove or cure at or prior to Closing (the \u201cResponse Notice\u201d). AB will not, in any event, be obligated to seek removal, cure of, or otherwise remedy exceptions that are (a) nonmonetary exceptions that do not prohibit or materially interfere with the use of the Owned Real Estate as bank branch locations or as otherwise used by AB or the Bank as of the Execution Date, (b) monetary or non-monetary exceptions disclosed in the AB Financial Statements, or (c) matters that GBCI has not taken objection to in an Objection Notice (such title exceptions together, \u201cPermitted Exceptions\u201d). AB will in good faith use commercially reasonable efforts, at AB\u2019s expense, to remove, cure, or otherwise remedy any matters set forth in the Response Notice that are not Permitted Exceptions that are susceptible to cure. At Closing, if requested by GBCI, AB will reasonably cooperate, at GBCI\u2019s expense, with GBCI\u2019s efforts to cause the Title Companies to provide GBCI with standard coverage title insurance policies issued with respect to each of the Properties constituting Owned Real Estate, in an amount commensurate with the value of each   -36-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nsuch Property as agreed upon by GBCI and AB, dated as of the Effective Date, insuring fee title in GBCI or such Subsidiary of GBCI, as so designated by GBCI, and that each such Property is unencumbered by any Liens, other than the Permitted Exceptions. \n\n\n4.1.11 Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Liability. Before the Effective Date, AB will notify its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurers of the Merger and of all pending or, to the Knowledge of AB, threatened claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations asserted or claimed against any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.3 and known to AB, or circumstances reasonably deemed by GBCI to be likely to give rise thereto, in accordance with terms and conditions of the applicable policies. \n\n\n4.1.12 Review of Loans. AB and the Bank will permit GBCI and its advisors, at GBCI\u2019s sole cost and expense, to conduct an examination of the Bank\u2019s loans to determine credit quality and the adequacy of the Bank\u2019s ACL and to establish, following the Effective Time, appropriate accounting adjustments under Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GBCI and its advisors will have continued access to the Bank\u2019s loans through Closing to update its examination. At GBCI\u2019s reasonable request, the Bank will provide GBCI with current reports updating the information set forth in Schedule 3.1.13. \n\n\n4.2 Conduct of GBCI\u2019s and its Subsidiaries\u2019 Businesses Prior to Closing. GBCI and Glacier Bank covenant that, from the Execution Date and prior to Closing, without prior written consent of AB (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), subject to applicable Law and except (w) as set forth on Schedule 4.2, (x) as required by the FDIC, the Montana Commissioner, the Federal Reserve or other applicable regulatory authority (so long as AB receives prior written notice of such required action), (y) specifically contemplated by this Agreement (including in the Disclosure Schedule), or (z) any Covid-19 Action, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or an earlier Termination Date, GBCI and Glacier Bank will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct their respective business only in the ordinary course of business in all material respects. 4.3 Registration Statement; AB Shareholders Meeting. \n\n\n4.3.1 Preparation of Registration Statement. \n\n\n(a) GBCI and AB will use their commercially reasonable efforts to jointly prepare and jointly file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (together with any amendments or supplements, the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) for registration of the GBCI Shares to be issued in the Merger and a related prospectus/proxy statement (the \u201cProspectus/Proxy Statement\u201d) with the SEC within 45 days after the Execution Date. \n\n\n(b) The parties will cooperate with each other in preparing the Registration Statement and Prospectus/Proxy Statement, and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain the clearance of the SEC, if required, any appropriate state securities regulators and any other required regulatory approvals, to issue the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. \n\n\n(c) Each party will provide the other party for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as applicable, all required information relating to such party or its Affiliates as the party making such filing may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Registration Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as applicable) and any amendments or supplements thereto. Each party and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, as applicable, including any amendments thereto and related correspondence with the SEC, before it is filed with the SEC. Nothing will be included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or any proxy solicitation materials with respect to any party to this Agreement unless approved by that party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. When the Registration Statement becomes effective, and at all times subsequent to such effectiveness (up to and including the date of the AB Meeting), all information set forth in the   -37-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nRegistration Statement that is or to be furnished by or on behalf of GBCI relating to GBCI and its Subsidiaries and by or on behalf of AB relating to AB and the Bank, (i) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirements, and (ii) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact that is required to be stated or necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement not misleading; provided, however, that in no event will any party be liable for any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement where such statement or omission, as the case may be, was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information concerning another party furnished by or on behalf of such other party specifically for use in the Registration Statement. \n\n\n(d) GBCI will pay all fees and costs associated with the preparation by GBCI\u2019s counsel (and other professional advisors) and the filing of the Registration Statement. AB will pay all fees and costs associated with its review and preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, with all such fees and costs to be included as and in the calculation of Transaction Related Expenses. Each of AB and GBCI will pay (a) one-half of the costs associated with the printing and mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to AB\u2019s shareholders and (b) its own other direct costs incurred by it in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, with all such costs paid by AB to be included as and in the calculation of Transaction Related Expenses. \n\n\n4.3.2 Submission to Shareholders. AB will promptly take the actions necessary in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to convene a shareholders\u2019 meeting to consider the approval of this Agreement and to authorize the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, the \u201cAB Meeting\u201d). The AB Meeting will be held on the earliest practical date after the date the Prospectus/Proxy Statement may first be sent to AB\u2019s shareholders without objection by applicable Governmental Authorities. The board of directors of AB has adopted a resolution recommending approval of this Agreement and the Merger by AB\u2019s shareholders, and it shall not withdraw, modify, or qualify its recommendation unless, subsequent to the Execution Date, AB receives a Superior Proposal and the board of directors of AB determines, in good faith and upon the written advice of independent legal counsel, that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to withdraw, modify, or qualify such recommendation. AB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the shareholders of AB approval of this Agreement in accordance with Utah Law, including (except as provided in the preceding sentence) by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to applicable Law, AB shall adjourn or postpone the AB Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of AB Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if, on the date of such AB Meeting, (a) AB has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the required approval by AB\u2019s shareholders and such approval remains possible to obtain and (b) the shareholders of AB have authorized by the requisite vote under Utah Law the adjournment pursuant to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement; provided that AB shall only be required to adjourn the AB Meeting two times pursuant to this Section 4.3.2. \n\n\n4.4 Submission to Regulatory Authorities. GBCI and AB will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare, promptly file (but in any event within 45 days of the Execution Date) and timely effect all documentation, applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain all permits, approvals, consents, authorizations, waivers, clearances and orders of or from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Montana Commissioner and Utah Department of Financial Institutions and any other Governmental Authority, in each case, required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Transactions (the \u201cRequisite Regulatory Approvals\u201d), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents of third parties which are necessary or advisable to consummate the Transaction. GBCI will provide to AB copies of all non-confidential portions of such documentation, applications, notices, petitions and filings for review and comment by AB prior to their submission to the applicable Governmental Authorities. These   -38-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ndocumentation, applications, notices, petitions and filings are expected to include (a) an interagency bank merger application to be filed with the FDIC and a waiver to be sought from the Federal Reserve, pursuant to Federal Reserve Regulation Y \u00a7 225.12(d) with respect to the Merger; (b) an application or notice to the Montana Commissioner and Utah Department of Financial Institutions and related filings regarding the Transactions; and (c) filings and coordination with the offices of the Secretary of State of Montana and the Utah Division of Corporations, with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger. AB and the Bank will cooperate with GBCI and use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist GBCI in obtaining all Requisite Regulatory Approvals. AB and the Bank shall reasonably cooperate with GBCI and, upon request, furnish GBCI with all information concerning itself, and its directors, officers, and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice, or application made by or on behalf of GBCI, Glacier Bank, AB, or the Bank to any third party or Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction. 4.5 Public Announcements. Subject to advice of legal counsel with respect to legal requirements relating to public disclosure of matters related to this Agreement and its subject matter, the timing and content of any announcements, press releases or other public statements concerning the Merger or the Bank Merger will occur upon, and be determined by, the mutual consent of AB and GBCI. 4.6 Consents. Each party to this Agreement will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the timely consent or approval of any other Person whose consent or approval is necessary or appropriate in order to permit GBCI or AB and Glacier Bank or the Bank to consummate the Merger or the Bank Merger. 4.7 Transition. During the period from the Execution Date to the Effective Time, AB and the Bank shall cause one or more of their respective representatives to confer with representatives of GBCI and Glacier Bank and report the general status of their ongoing operations at such times as GBCI and Glacier Bank may reasonably request. Representatives of GBCI, Glacier Bank, AB, and the Bank shall also meet as reasonably requested by or on behalf of GBCI to discuss and plan for the conversion of the Bank\u2019s data processing and related electronic informational systems to those used by GBCI and Glacier Bank, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, discussion of the possible termination by the Bank of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used by the Bank in connection with its systems operations, retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion, and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided system services, it being understood that neither AB nor the Bank shall be obligated to take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless AB and the Bank otherwise agree, no conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, no such request by or behalf of GBCI or Glacier Bank shall interfere materially with the performance of duties by any employee of AB or the Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else set forth in this Agreement, nothing shall give GBCI or Glacier Bank, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct AB\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, AB and the Bank will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their operations. 4.8 Notice of Certain Events; Cooperation. GBCI and AB will each provide the other with prompt written notice of: (a) any events that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it, (b) the commencement of any investigation, action or proceeding against it by or before any court or Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it, and (c) any shareholder or other litigation or community-based protests, or any threat of such litigation or protest, against such party or its directors relating in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep the other party fully informed regarding any such shareholder or other litigation or protests, or threat related thereto, including providing all relevant documentation reasonably requested. No settlement shall be agreed to without GBCI\u2019s prior written consent. The parties will reasonably cooperate with each other in all material respects between the Execution Date and Closing to resolve any fact or circumstance identified by a party that would give rise to a breach of any of the representations, warranties,   -39-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nagreements or covenants in this Agreement if such facts or circumstances had been present as of the Execution Date. In addition, AB will notify GBCI in the event it or any AB Subsidiary acquires a fee ownership or leasehold interest in any real property, as specified in Section 4.1.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.8 to the contrary, a failure to provide notice pursuant to this Section 4.8 shall not, in and of itself, result in a failure of any condition to the obligation of any party to consummate the Merger pursuant to Article 5 unless the underlying event would independently result in a failure to meet any such condition. 4.9 Confidentiality. Subject to the requirements of Law, each party will keep and hold as confidential, and will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to keep and hold as confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Agreement unless such information (a) is required by Law to be disclosed, (b) becomes available to such party from other sources not bound by a confidentiality obligation, (c) is disclosed with prior written approval of the party to which such information pertains or is disclosed in a legal action between the parties relating to this Agreement or the Transaction, or (d) is or becomes public without fault of the subject party. If this Agreement is terminated or the Merger otherwise fails to be consummated, each party to this Agreement will remain bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in accordance with its terms. 4.10 Listing. Prior to the Effective Time, GBCI shall cause to be filed with the NASDAQ Global Select Market such notices of issuance or related forms as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with issuance of the GBCI Shares in the Merger. 4.11 Blue Sky Filings. GBCI will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the mailing of the Registration Statement, any necessary state securities Laws or \u201cBlue Sky\u201d permits and approvals. 4.12 Tax Treatment. Neither GBCI and its Subsidiaries nor AB and the AB Subsidiaries will take or cause to be taken any action that would or could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under IRC Section 368(a). Each of GBCI and its Subsidiaries and AB and the AB Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under IRC Section 368(a). The parties shall report the Merger for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with qualification as a reorganization under IRC Section 368(a). 4.13 AB Closing Capital. No earlier than the 15th Business Day prior to the parties\u2019 agreed-upon anticipated date of Closing (the \u201cAnticipated Closing Date\u201d) nor later than the 11th Business Day before the Anticipated Closing Date, AB shall calculate in good faith and provide to GBCI the estimated AB Capital as of the Anticipated Closing Date and shall provide GBCI with a copy of the proposed Subsequent AB Financial Statements and Subsequent Bank Financial Statements for the month preceding the date of calculation (if not already provided in accordance with Section 4.1.8), together with internally prepared financial statements through the date of calculation, estimated retained earnings through the Anticipated Closing Date, the impact of any pending adjustments required in the calculation of the estimated AB Capital, and any other documentation reasonably requested by GBCI for purposes of confirming the amount of such estimated AB Capital. GBCI shall review such materials and, within three Business Days following receipt thereof, notify AB as to whether GBCI accepts or disputes the amount of the estimated AB Capital. If GBCI disputes such calculation in good faith, it shall describe in its notice its specific requested changes or adjustments. If GBCI and AB are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations within three Business Days after delivery of GBCI\u2019s notice of objection, then the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved by, an accounting firm that is mutually and reasonably acceptable to, and independent of, the parties (the \u201cIndependent Accountants\u201d). The Independent Accountants shall review the matter in dispute and, solely as to disputes relating to accounting issues and acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, determine and report in writing to GBCI and AB the resolution of such disputed matters and the effect of such determinations on the calculation of the AB Capital estimated as of the Anticipated Closing Date (unadjusted for any delay that may have been caused by the Independent Accountants\u2019 review of the matter(s) in dispute), and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive unless GBCI and AB mutually agree upon a different amount. The AB Capital estimated as of Closing, as determined and agreed upon in writing by GBCI and   -40-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nAB in accordance with this Section 4.13, is the \u201cAB Closing Capital.\u201d The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants pursuant to this Section 4.13 and Section 4.14 below shall be shared equally by GBCI, on the one hand, and AB, on the other hand, and AB\u2019s portion shall be an expense in the calculation of the AB Closing Capital. 4.14 Transaction Related Expenses. No earlier than the 15th Business Day prior to Closing nor later than the 11th Business Day before such Closing, AB shall calculate in good faith the estimated Transaction Related Expenses as of the Closing and shall provide GBCI with a copy of a schedule in the form of Exhibit B detailing each Transaction Related Expense and any other documentation reasonably requested by GBCI for purposes of confirming the amount of such Transaction Related Expenses. GBCI shall review such materials and, within three Business Days following receipt thereof, notify AB as to whether GBCI accepts or disputes the amount of the estimated Transaction Related Expenses. If GBCI disputes such calculation in good faith, it shall describe in its notice its specific requested changes or adjustments. If GBCI and AB are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations within three Business Days after delivery of GBCI\u2019s notice of objection, then the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved by the Independent Accountants in accordance with the process set forth in Section 4.13. The Transaction Related Expenses estimated as of Closing, as determined and agreed upon in writing by GBCI and AB in accordance with this Section 4.14, are the \u201cFinal Transaction Related Expenses.\u201d \n\n\n4.15 Payment of Dividend; Adjustment to Per Share Stock Consideration \n\n\n4.15.1 Payment of Dividend. If the AB Closing Capital exceeds the Closing Capital Requirement (i.e., the Closing Capital Differential is a positive number) after making all adjustments required by the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation in the event the Final Transaction Related Expenses exceed the Maximum Transaction Expenses Amount), AB may, upon prior written notice to GBCI not less than 10 Business Days prior to Closing and effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, declare and pay a special dividend to its shareholders in an amount equal to the positive Closing Capital Differential. \n\n\n4.15.2 Adjustment to Per Share Stock Consideration. If the AB Closing Capital is less than the Closing Capital Requirement (i.e. the Closing Capital Differential is a negative number) after making all adjustments required by the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, in the event the Final Transaction Related Expenses exceed the Maximum Transaction Expenses Amount), then the Per Share Stock Consideration will be reduced on a per share basis by an amount, rounded to the nearest thousandth (referred to as the \u201cStock Consideration Per Share Adjustment Amount\u201d), determined by dividing the remaining balance in the negative Closing Capital Differential by the GBCI Average Closing Price, and dividing that result by the number of shares of AB Stock outstanding at the Effective Time. \n\n\n4.16 Commercially Reasonable Efforts(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable Laws, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger, as soon as reasonably practicable, and to otherwise enable consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to any delays resulting from SEC review or bank regulatory processing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, GBCI and its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to Requisite Regulatory Approvals and to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals as promptly as possible after the Execution Date, and no later than the Outside Date; provided that GBCI shall not be required to take any action in furtherance of this Section 4.16 that would be reasonably likely to deprive GBCI of the economic or business benefits of the Transactions in a manner that is material relative to the aggregate economic or business benefits of the Transaction to GBCI. 4.17 GBCI Common Stock Issuable in Merger. The GBCI Shares, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and subject to no preemptive rights.   -41-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n4.18 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the boards of directors of GBCI and AB, or a committee of nonemployee directors thereof (as such terms is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any (a) disposition of AB Stock held by officers or directors of AB subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (such \u201cAB Insiders\u201d), or (b) acquisition of GBCI Common Stock by such AB Insiders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent necessary based on such AB Insiders position immediately following the Merger), to be exempt from short-swing profit liability to the fullest extent authorized under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 4.19 Tax Information. From the Execution Date and prior to Closing, AB will, and will cause each AB Subsidiary to, reasonably cooperate with GBCI in preparing and obtaining any Tax information relating to AB and the AB Subsidiaries reasonably requested by GBCI, such as asset basis, net operating losses, credits or similar tax attributes, or further information on the tax treatment of particular transactions effected, or Tax Returns filed by AB or AB Subsidiaries. \n\n\nARTICLE 5 \n\n\nAPPROVALS AND CONDITIONS \n\n\n5.1 Required Approvals.

GBCI\u2019s and Glacier Bank\u2019s personnel policies will apply to any current Employees who are retained after the Effective Time (collectively, the \u201cContinuing Employees\u201d). Such Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate in all of the benefit plans of GBCI and/or Glacier Bank that are generally available to similarly situated employees of GBCI and/or Glacier Bank in accordance with and subject to the terms of such plans. From the date of the Closing until the first anniversary thereof, GBCI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to, provide to each Continuing Employee (A) monetary base and incentive compensation opportunities that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to over the long term, those provided by AB or its Affiliates to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (B) benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing (it being understood that GBCI\u2019s benefit plans and plan terms are different than AB\u2019s benefit plans), taken as a whole. \n\n\n6.2.2 Treatment of Past Service. For purposes of such participation, current Employees\u2019 prior service with AB and/or the Bank will constitute prior service with GBCI or Glacier Bank for all purposes (including but not limited to vacation time and participation and benefits under the applicable GBCI or Glacier Bank severance plan for employees in effect at the time of any termination). \n\n\n6.2.3 No Contract Created. Nothing in this Agreement will give any Employee a right to employment or continuing employment. \n\n\n6.2.4 Severance Eligibility. Any current Employees (a) who are not entitled to severance, change in control, or other payments at or in connection with Closing under the Compensation Plans set forth in Schedule 3.1.16(c) or otherwise, and (b) are not offered a position by GBCI or continued to be employed by Glacier Bank on the date that is one year following the Effective Date will receive severance payments in accordance with Glacier Bank\u2019s severance policy in effect at the Closing on the basis of the number of years of prior service with AB and the Bank, at the expense of GBCI. \n\n\n6.3 Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers. \n\n\n6.3.1 For a period of six years from and after the Effective Date, GBCI will indemnify and defend each present and former director and officer of AB and the Bank (the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, judgments, fines, damages, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions accruing at or prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, the Merger to the fullest extent that AB and/or the Bank is currently permitted to indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors and officers under applicable Law, including federal banking Law, and under their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the Execution Date or written contract with AB or the Bank in effect on the Execution Date; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made in accordance with this Section 6.3 shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. GBCI shall advance expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) as incurred to the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent that such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under applicable articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the Execution Date or written contract with AB or the Bank in effect on the Execution Date. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officer\u2019s or director\u2019s conduct complies with the standard set forth under AB\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws will be made by independent counsel (which will not be counsel that provides any services to GBCI or any of its Subsidiaries) selected by GBCI and reasonably acceptable to such officer or director. \n\n\n6.3.2 Prior to the Effective Time, GBCI will purchase, at its sole cost and expense, and AB will reasonably cooperate with GBCI\u2019s efforts to purchase, a six-year tail policy for AB\u2019s current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance prior to the Effective Time; provided that the premiums for such policy shall not exceed 250 percent of the current annualized premiums; and provided further that, GBCI may substitute therefor   -45-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\npolicies with reputable insurers of at least the same coverage and scope, and in amount, and containing terms and conditions, that are no less favorable to such individuals than such policy in effect on the date hereof. \n\n\n6.3.3 The provisions of this Section 6.3 will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under AB\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of GBCI pursuant to this Section 6.3 (and the \u201ctail policy\u201d obtained pursuant thereto) may not be terminated, canceled or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.3 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law, or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.3 applies will be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.3). \n\n\n6.3.4 In the event GBCI or any of its respective successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of GBCI, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3. \n\n\n6.4 AB ESOP. After the date hereof and in any event prior to the Closing, AB shall have adopted an amendment to the AB ESOP providing that, upon the Closing, (a) the AB ESOP shall be terminated as of the Closing, (b) no new participants shall be admitted to the AB ESOP after the Closing, (c) AB ESOP participants\u2019 accounts shall be fully vested and 100 percent non-forfeitable on and after the Closing, and (d) the AB ESOP shall permit the entire balance of a participant\u2019s account to be distributable following the receipt of approvals of the Internal Revenue Service determined to be appropriate that such termination does not adversely affect the AB ESOP\u2019s tax-qualified status. \n\n\nARTICLE 7 \n\n\nTERMINATION OF AGREEMENT AND ABANDONMENT OF TRANSACTION \n\n\n7.1 Termination by Reason of Lapse of Time. If Closing does not occur on or before February 28, 2022 (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d), either GBCI or AB may terminate this Agreement and the Merger if the terminating party delivers to the other party written notice that its board of directors has voted in favor of termination; provided that, if as of such Outside Date, the condition to Closing set forth in Section 5.1 shall not have been satisfied, then the Outside Date will be extended to on or before April 30, 2022, if either AB or GBCI notifies the other party in writing on or prior to the Outside Date of its election to extend the Outside Date; and provided, further that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Merger to be completed by the applicable Outside Date. \n\n\n7.2 Termination Due to GBCI Average Closing Price Greater Than $74.15. \n\n\n7.2.1 GBCI\u2019s Right to Terminate. Subject to Section 7.2.2, by specific action of its board of directors, GBCI may terminate this Agreement and the Merger by written notice to AB on the Business Day immediately following the Determination Date, if the GBCI Average Closing Price is greater than $74.15. Prior to a termination pursuant to this Section 7.2.1, the parties will have made appropriate adjustments to take into account the declaration or effects of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction involving the issuance of GBCI Common Stock for which no consideration is received between the Execution Date and the Determination Date. \n\n\n7.2.2 AB\u2019s Right to Adjust Consideration. If GBCI provides written notice to AB in accordance with Section 7.2.1, then within three Business Days following AB\u2019s receipt of such notice, AB may elect by   -46-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nwritten notice to GBCI to accept an adjustment to the Per Share Stock Consideration through the issuance of fewer GBCI Shares; in such event, the Total Consideration Value Per Share shall equal $59.10. If AB makes such election to accept a decrease in the number of GBCI Shares to be issued as the Per Share Stock Consideration, no termination will occur pursuant to Section 7.2.1, and this Agreement will remain in effect according to its terms (except as the Per Share Stock Consideration has been adjusted). \n\n\n7.3 Termination Due to GBCI Average Closing Price Less Than $49.43. \n\n\n7.3.1 AB\u2019s Right to Terminate. Subject to Section 7.3.2, by specific action of its board of directors, AB may terminate this Agreement and the Merger by written notice to GBCI on the Business Day immediately following the Determination Date, if the GBCI Average Closing Price is less than $49.43. Prior to a termination pursuant to this Section 7.3.1, the parties will have made appropriate adjustments to take into account the declaration or effects of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction involving the issuance of GBCI Common Stock for which no consideration is received between the Execution Date and the Determination Date. \n\n\n7.3.2 GBCI\u2019s Right to Adjust Consideration. If AB provides written notice to GBCI in accordance with Section 7.3.1, then within three Business Days following GBCI\u2019s receipt of such notice, GBCI may elect by written notice to AB to adjust the Per Share Stock Consideration such that the Total Consideration Value Per Share equals $39.40 (based on the GBCI Average Closing Price rounded up to the nearest whole share). If GBCI makes such election to increase the Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 7.3.2, no termination will occur pursuant to Section 7.3.1, and this Agreement will remain in effect according to its terms (except as the Per Share Stock Consideration has been adjusted). \n\n\n7.4 Other Grounds for Termination. This Agreement and the Merger may be terminated at any time before Closing (whether before or after applicable approval of this Agreement by AB\u2019s shareholders, unless otherwise provided) by AB (on behalf of itself and the Bank) or GBCI (on behalf of itself and Glacier Bank) as follows: \n\n\n7.4.1 Mutual Consent. By mutual consent of AB and GBCI, if the board of directors of each party agrees to terminate by a majority vote of all of its members. \n\n\n7.4.2 No Regulatory Approvals.

Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, and subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and each party agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably accept comments of the other parties thereon.  Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to each other copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws.  Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority with respect to any consent, approval, authorization or waiver required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver will be materially delayed or conditioned.  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, permit any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, shareholders or any other Representatives to participate in any live or telephonic meeting (other than non-substantive scheduling or administrative calls) with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.

Subject to Section 6.06, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Board of Directors shall recommend approval of this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company Voting Shareholders (the \u201cCompany Recommendation\u201d) and include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.  Unless this Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under circumstances as specified in Section 6.06, take all lawful action to solicit from the Company Voting Shareholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company Required Vote.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Voting Shareholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Company Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.  In addition, the Company may and the Company shall, to the extent requested by Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting for a period or periods of up to thirty (30) days in the aggregate to permit additional time to solicit the Company Required Vote in the event that proxies constituting the Company Required Vote have not been received by the Company.

The Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all then existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and terminate all access to nonpublic information of the Company or its Subsidiaries that any such Person may have.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal received after the date of this Agreement that did not arise in whole or part due to a material breach of this Section 6.06, if the Company Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Subsidiaries and Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 6.06(c) and only prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no more favorable in the aggregate to such Person than those contained in the Company Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of a Takeover Proposal); provided that all material information provided to such Person has previously been provided or made available to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person (which nonpublic information shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to the Company Confidentiality Agreement and may, in order to comply with applicable Law, be restricted to certain designated Representatives of Parent), and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. (b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation or the approval, declaration of advisability or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve, recommend the approval of, or publicly propose to approve or recommend the adoption of, any Takeover Proposal or enter into or publicly propose to enter into any Takeover Proposal Documentation, (iii) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of a written request by Parent to make such public reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company of a public Takeover Proposal that has not been publicly withdrawn (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal in the form of a tender offer or exchange offer, which shall be governed by clause (vi) below) (it being agreed that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any Takeover Proposal deemed to have been made pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stockholder Support and Contingent Sale Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2020, by and among certain of the Company\u2019s shareholders and the other parties thereto absent subsequent action on or after the date of this Agreement by any party thereto that would constitute a Takeover Proposal); provided that Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10) Business Day period, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Law or takeover-related provision of the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company By-Laws inapplicable to a Takeover Proposal, (v) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (vi) fail to recommend against a tender offer or exchange offer prior to the earlier of (A) the tenth (10th) Business Day after commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer and (B) the later of the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and the fifth (5th) Business Day after commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer (it being understood that any \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) (each of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), an \u201cAdverse Recommendation Change\u201d). (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change in Circumstance, (y) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (z) cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, if and only if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(i) the Company shall have given Parent notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change or causing or permitting the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (y) above, which notice shall include (A) the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and copies of proposed definitive documentation with respect to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that (1) any amendment to any financial terms or other terms that are material of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period prior to taking any specified action and (2) in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing to the Company (and not revoked) in response to any such notice or otherwise within the periods described above) or (B) a reasonably detailed description of the material event or development constituting such Change in Circumstance; \n\n\n(ii) the Company has and has caused its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to make themselves reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during the period referred to in clause (i) above to the extent requested in writing by Parent in order to permit Parent to propose one or more amendments to this Agreement that would result in such Takeover Proposal ceasing to constitute a Superior Proposal or such other matter no longer constituting a Change in Circumstance; \n\n\n(iii) after considering any proposed binding offers to amend this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent (and not revoked) during the period referred to in clause (i) above, if any, the Company Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal or Change in Circumstance or cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law. \n\n\n(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.06(a), Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.06(c), the Company shall as promptly as practicable (in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) advise Parent of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal.  The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto). (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(c) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company Shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law or otherwise required under applicable Law, it being understood, however, that nothing in clause (i) or (ii) shall be deemed to alter the definition of an Adverse Recommendation Change as provided by Section 6.06(b) or permit the Company Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by and in compliance with Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.06(c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.07 Public Announcements.  The Company and Parent shall agree on a press release announcing the entering into of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements (including scheduling of a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement (a) as may be required by Law or Order, the applicable rules and regulations of, in the case of the Company, the Nasdaq Global Market or any listing agreement with the Nasdaq Global Market, or, in the case of Parent, the applicable rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange or (b) as contemplated by Section 6.06(e) or (c) to enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement. Section 6.08  Employee Matters. (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31 of the year in which Closing occurs, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed as of immediately prior to the Closing (each such employee, a \u201cCompany Employee\u201d) with a base salary or hourly base wage rate that is at least equal to the base salary or hourly base wage rate provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing, except as otherwise mutually agreed to between Parent and a Company Employee.  During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs (the \u201cContinuation Period\u201d), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to, each Company Employee with (i) a short- term incentive compensation target opportunity that is at least equal to the short-term incentive compensation target opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity compensation and 401(k) profit sharing contributions) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing. (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.08(a), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to, each Company Employee who incurs an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause during the Continuation Period with severance payments and benefits to which such Company Employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under any Benefit Plan disclosed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter had such termination of employment occurred immediately prior to the Closing. (c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all obligations under the offer letters, employment agreements, severance agreements, non-competition agreements or other similar agreements listed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or as they may be amended prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted by this Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 6.08(c) shall be interpreted as limiting Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (as applicable) from exercising any and all rights reserved to the Company or its Subsidiaries under any such agreements or as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue to employ any individual. (d) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of the Company and its Subsidiaries) solely to the extent such plans provide benefits to any Company Employee after the Closing Date (the \u201cNew Plans\u201d), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such Company Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the foregoing service credit shall not be required to apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.  In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the \u201cOld Plans\u201d), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively- at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employee\u2019s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of- pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.08(a), in respect of the Company\u2019s fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause to, honor and pay to each Company Employee an annual cash bonus (the \u201cAnnual Bonus\u201d) payable pursuant to the Company Annual Incentive Plan disclosed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the \u201cCompany Incentive Plan\u201d) no later than the time such Annual Bonus is due under the applicable Company Incentive Plans and prior to March 15 of the year following the year in which the Closing occurs (the \u201cPayment Date\u201d); provided that if the Company Employee incurs an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause prior to the Payment Date, such Company Employee\u2019s Annual Bonus shall be pro-rated based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Company Employee was employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates during the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs and the denominator of which is 365. Parent shall, or shall cause to, operate the Company Incentive Plan and measure the level of performance achievement in a good faith manner consistent with the Company\u2019s past practice. (f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as a \u201cchange in control,\u201d \u201cchange of control,\u201d or similar term of the Company under the terms of the Benefit Plans, as applicable. (g) The Company shall take, or cause its Subsidiaries to take, all actions necessary, including adopting written resolutions, to terminate, effective immediately before the Closing and contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, any Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (a \u201cCompany 401(k) Plan\u201d), and effective immediately prior to the Closing, (i) all participants in any Company 401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their account balances and (ii) no employee or other Person shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to such Company 401(k) Plan based upon compensation earned or services performed after the Closing.  The Company will provide Parent with a copy of such proposed resolutions terminating such Company 401(k) Plan prior to adoption thereof by the Company Board of Directors and shall thereafter deliver evidence to Parent that the Company Board of Directors approved such resolutions.  Parent shall designate or establish, or cause to be established, a defined contribution retirement plan of the Parent or one of its Affiliates that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the \u201cPurchaser 401(k) Plan\u201d) for which Company Employees shall become eligible to participate effective as of the Closing Date.  Parent shall take all reasonable steps necessary to cause such Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan, including the in-kind rollover of any associated plan loans of each Company Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code.  The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Company Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the promissory notes evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans. (h) This Section 6.08 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.08 or any other provision of this Agreement or any other related Contract, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) is intended to or shall confer upon any current or former director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other person any right, including any right to employment or continued employment or service for any period of time by reason of this Agreement or any other related agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.09 Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, relating to or in connection with any act or omission occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including relating to this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by the IBCL or any other applicable Law or provided under the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws in effect on the date hereof.  Parent hereby guarantees such performance by the Surviving Corporation. (b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Parties with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as those of such current insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with the same or better financial strength ratings as the Company\u2019s current carriers; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the \u201cMaximum Premium\u201d); provided, further, that, if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; provided, further, however, that at the Company\u2019s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year \u201ctail\u201d insurance policy that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above; provided that the Company does not pay more than 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance policy. (c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.  Further, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties than are presently set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company By-Laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as amendments may be required by the IBCL during such period. (d) This Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and their respective successors, heirs and representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, heirs and representatives). (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.09.  In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.09.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.09 shall be in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (or who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity securities of the Company. Section 6.11 Share Exchange De-listing.  Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Company\u2019s securities to be de-listed from the Nasdaq Global Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. Section 6.12 Takeover Laws.  The Company and the Company Board of Directors shall, if any Takeover Law or any takeover- related provision in the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company By-Laws becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than those arising under insurance acquisition of control Laws), take all necessary action to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to make such Takeover Law or such takeover-related provision in the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company By-Laws inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Section 6.13 Shareholder Litigation.  The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any Action brought by any shareholder of the Company against the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation.

Parent shall promptly advise the Company orally and in writing of any Action brought by any shareholder of Parent against Parent or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep the Company reasonably informed regarding any such litigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.14  No Control of the Other Party\u2019s Business.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019 operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019 operations prior to the Effective Time.

Upon the written request of Parent, and at Parent\u2019s expense, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to arrange for the payoff of all outstanding amounts under, and termination of, the Company\u2019s existing credit facility as of the Closing Date and use reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff letters and lien releases (or a grant of authority to the Company to file lien releases) with respect thereto in forms reasonably satisfactory to Parent.  Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation.  For the avoidance of doubt, no payoff and termination shall be a condition to Closing or be effective prior to the Effective Time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nArticle VII \n\n\nCONDITIONS TO CLOSING Section 7.01 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party.

Annual meetings of the board of directors shall be held immediately following annual meetings of the shareholders, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.  If no annual meeting of the shareholders is held, or if directors are not elected thereat, then the annual meeting of the board of directors shall be held immediately following any special meeting of the shareholders at which directors are elected, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

Such notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of the meeting and may be given in any manner or method and at such time so that the director receiving it may have reasonable opportunity to attend the meeting.  Such notice shall, in all events, be deemed to have been properly and duly given if mailed at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting and directed to the residence of each director as shown upon the secretary\u2019s records.

The executive committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the board of directors when required.

ARTICLE V Indemnification and Insurance Section 1.  Indemnification.  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, every Eligible Person shall be indemnified by the Corporation against all Liability and reasonable Expense that may be incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any Claim, (a) if such Eligible Person is Wholly Successful with respect to the Claim, or (b) if not Wholly Successful, then if such Eligible Person is determined, as provided in either Section 3(a) or 3(b) of Article V of these Bylaws, to have acted in good faith, in what he reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Corporation or at least not opposed to its best interests and, in addition, with respect to any criminal claim is determined to have had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Claim, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), or conviction or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that an Eligible Person did not meet the standards of conduct set forth in clause (b) of this Section 1 of Article V of these Bylaws. The actions of an Eligible Person with respect to an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be deemed to have been taken in what the Eligible Person reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Corporation or at least not opposed to its best interests if the Eligible Person reasonably believed he was acting in conformity with the requirements of such Act or he reasonably believed his actions to be in the interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. Section 2.  Definitions. (a) The term \u201cClaim\u201d as used in this Article V shall include every pending, threatened, or completed claim, action, suit, or proceeding and all appeals thereof (whether brought by or in the right of this Corporation or any other corporation or otherwise), civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, formal or informal, in which an Eligible Person may become involved, as a party or otherwise (i) by reason of his being or having been an Eligible Person, or (ii) by reason of any action taken or not taken by him in his capacity as an Eligible Person, whether or not he continued in such capacity at the time such Liability or Expense shall have been incurred. (b) The term \u201cEligible Person\u201d as used in this Article V shall mean every person (and the estate, heirs, and personal representatives of such person) who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation. (c) The terms \u201cLiability\u201d and \u201cExpense\u201d as used in this Article V shall include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgments, fines, or penalties against (including excise taxes assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan), and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of an Eligible Person. (d) The term \u201cWholly Successful\u201d as used in this Article VI shall mean (i) termination of any claim against the Eligible Person in question without any finding of liability or guilt against him, (ii) approval by a court, with knowledge of the indemnity herein provided, of a settlement of any Claim, or (iii) the expiration of a reasonable period of time after the making or threatened making of any Claim without the institution of the same, without any payment or promise made to induce a settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 3. Determination of Conduct. (a) Every Eligible Person claiming indemnification hereunder (other than one who has been Wholly Successful with respect to any Claim) shall be entitled to indemnification (i) if special independent legal counsel, which may be regular counsel of the Corporation, or other disinterested person or persons, in either case selected by the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists (such counsel or person or persons being hereinafter called the \u201cReferee\u201d), shall deliver to the Corporation a written finding that such Eligible Person has met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 1(b) of Article V of these Bylaws, and (ii) if the Board of Directors, acting upon such written finding, so determines. The Board of Directors shall, if an Eligible Person is found to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person\u2019s Expenses. The Eligible Person claiming indemnification shall, if requested, appear before the Referee, answer questions that the Referee deems relevant and shall be given ample opportunity to present to the Referee evidence upon which the Eligible Person relies for indemnification. The Corporation shall, at the request of the Referee, make available facts, opinions, or other evidence in any way relevant to the Referee\u2019s findings that are within the possession or control of the Corporation. (b) If an Eligible Person claiming indemnification pursuant to Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws is found not to be entitled thereto, or if the Board of Directors fails to select a Referee under Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws within a reasonable amount of time following a written request of an Eligible Person for the selection of a Referee, or if the Referee or the Board of Directors fails to make a determination under Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws within a reasonable amount of time following the selection of a Referee, the Eligible Person may apply for indemnification with respect to a Claim to a court of competent jurisdiction, including a court in which the Claim is pending against the Eligible Person. On receipt of an application, the court, after giving notice to the Corporation and giving the Corporation ample opportunity to present to the court any information or evidence relating to the claim for indemnification that the Corporation deems appropriate, may order indemnification if it determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification with respect to the Claim because such Eligible Person met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 1(b) of Article V of these Bylaws. If the court determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification, the court shall also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person\u2019s Expenses. \n\n\nSection 4.  Non-Exclusivity.  The rights of indemnification provided in Article V of these Bylaws shall be in addition to any rights to which any Eligible Person may otherwise be entitled. Irrespective of the provisions of Article V of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, at any time and from time to time, (a) approve indemnification of any Eligible Person to the full extent permitted by the provisions of applicable law at the time in effect, whether on account of past or future transactions, and (b) authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Eligible Person against any Liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability. Section 5.  Advance Payment of Expenses.  Expenses incurred by an Eligible Person with respect to any Claim may be advanced by the Corporation (by action of the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists) prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Eligible Person to repay such amount unless he is determined to be entitled to indemnification. Section 6.  Miscellaneous. (a)  The provisions of Article V of these Bylaws shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Eligible Person, and an Eligible Person\u2019s rights hereunder shall not be diminished or otherwise adversely affected by any repeal, amendment, or modification of Article V of these Bylaws that occurs subsequent to such person becoming an Eligible Person. (b)  The provisions of Article V of these Bylaws shall be applicable to Claims made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after the adoption hereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nARTICLE VI Certificates for Shares Section 1.  Form and Execution.  Certificates for shares, certifying the number of full-paid shares owned, shall be issued to each shareholder in such form as shall be approved by the board of directors.  Such certificates shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president or a vice president and by the secretary or an assistant secretary or the treasurer or an assistant treasurer; provided, however, that the signatures of any of such officers and the seal of the Corporation upon such certificates may be facsimiles, engraved, stamped or printed.  If any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used, printed or stamped on any certificate or certificates for shares, shall cease to be such officer or officers, because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates shall nevertheless be as effective in all respects as though signed by a duly elected, qualified and authorized officer or officers, and as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be an officer or officers of the Corporation. Section 2.  Registration of Transfer.  Any certificate for shares of the Corporation shall be transferable in person or by attorney upon the surrender thereof to the Corporation or any transfer agent therefor (for the class of shares represented by the certificate surrendered) properly endorsed for transfer and accompanied by such assurances as the Corporation or such transfer agent may require as to the genuineness and effectiveness of each necessary endorsement. Section 3.  Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  A new share certificate or certificates may be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation which is alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken upon (i) the execution and delivery to the Corporation by the person claiming the certificate to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken of an affidavit of that fact, specifying whether or not, at the time of such alleged loss, destruction or taking, the certificate was endorsed, and (ii) the furnishing to the Corporation of indemnity and other assurances, if any, satisfactory to the Corporation and to all transfer agents and registrars of the class of shares represented by the certificate against any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses or liabilities to which they or any of them may be subjected by reason of the issue and delivery of such new certificate or certificates or in respect of the original certificate. Section 4.  Registered Shareholders.  A person in whose name shares are of record on the books of the Corporation shall conclusively be deemed the unqualified owner and holder thereof for all purposes and to have capacity to exercise all rights of ownership.  Neither the Corporation nor any transfer agent of the Corporation shall be bound to recognize any equitable interest in or claim to such shares on the part of any other person, whether disclosed upon such certificate or otherwise, nor shall they be obliged to see to the execution of any trust or obligation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nARTICLE VII Fiscal Year The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on such date in each year as shall be designated from time to time by the board of directors.  In the absence of such designation, the fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on December 31 in each year. ARTICLE VIII Seal The board of directors may provide a suitable seal containing the name of the Corporation.  If deemed advisable by the board of directors, duplicate seals may be provided and kept for the purposes of the Corporation.  The absence of the impression of the corporate seal from any document shall not affect in any way the validity or effect of such document. \n\n\nARTICLE IX Amendments These Bylaws shall be subject to alteration, amendment, repeal, or the adoption of new Bylaws  only by the board of directors of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSCHEDULE I GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS \n\n\n1.

(a) Exchange Agent. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Company\u2019s prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (in each case, other than holders of Excluded Shares), an amount in cash equal to any cash due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.03(d) and certificates or, at Parent\u2019s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the transmittal materials, pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and after the Effective Time, if applicable, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (such amount in cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). The Company shall notify Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time of the number of Shares and Excluded Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall cause the Company\u2019s transfer agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Closing Date a list of the holders of Company Common Stock in a format that is reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Exchange Agent.   -14-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 3.03(f)) and instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form and have such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree). Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable) representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(g)) equal to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Exchange Agent is presented with the Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, and if a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable, representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.   -15-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a). (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. (g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. (h) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.   -16-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n3.04 Treatment of Equity Awards.

For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cashout Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the \u201cEquity Award Cashout Price\u201d shall mean an amount equal to the product of (x) the Parent Average Closing Price and (y) the Exchange Ratio.

At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock award (a \u201cCompany Restricted Share\u201d) under the Company Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, shall be cancelled, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Restricted Shares to receive, on the first regular payroll date of the Company following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of such Company Restricted Shares and (ii) the Equity Award Cashout Price (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which Tax withholding may, at the election of the holder, be effected by deduction from such cash amount equal to the amount of Taxes to be withheld). (c) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a \u201cCompany RSU\u201d) under the Company Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, shall be cancelled, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company RSUs to receive, on the first regular payroll date of the Company following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of such Company RSUs and (ii) the Equity Award Cashout Price (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which Tax withholding may, at the election of the holder, be effected by deduction from such cash amount equal to the amount of Taxes to be withheld).   -17-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) Company Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any other reasonable actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSUs (the \u201cCompany Equity Awards\u201d) pursuant to Section 3.04(a) through 3.04(c).

The Company and Parent will cause the Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that if such Party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by such Party that would cause any of the statements in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or that would result in an omission to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other Party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. (c) (i) The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not: (A) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section 5.06(c)(ii) hereof, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger (a \u201cCompany Change of Recommendation\u201d); or (B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.08 entered into in compliance with Section 5.08) (an \u201cAlternative Acquisition Agreement\u201d) relating to any Acquisition Proposal made to the Company.

In determining whether to make a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice.

The Company and Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other Party. 5.07 Access; Information. (a) The Parties agree that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in each case subject to the requirements that such requests or access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Party, it shall afford the other Party and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to its books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), Contracts, properties and personnel and to such other information as such other Party may reasonably request (subject to compliance with all applicable Laws and commercially reasonable health and safety procedures imposed by such Party with respect to its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 employees) and, during such period, the Parties shall furnish to the other Party promptly all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request. (b) The Company agrees that, subject to applicable Laws, it shall cooperate in good faith with Parent on preparing for the development of mutually agreed operating issues to be implemented after the Effective Time, which the Parties agree have priority including assisting in developing and implementing plans for integration and conversion and other matters affecting branches, customers and back office operations.   -53-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c) Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to, hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.07 in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2021 (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d), between Parent and the Company. (d) No investigation by either Party of the business and affairs of the other Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Party\u2019s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.07 to the contrary, no Party shall be required to provide the other Party with access or disclose information where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable opinion of such Party\u2019s counsel, jeopardize the attorney- client privilege of the such Party, or contravene any binding Contract entered into by such Party prior to the date of this Agreement or any Law applicable to such Party. In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.07(e) shall apply, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Law. 5.08 Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; or (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be   -54-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nterminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.08. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly, but in no event later than the next succeeding Business Day, if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 5.09 Certain Policies . Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that Parent has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to effect the Merger, the Company and PM Bank shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDFPI, the Federal Reserve and applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of BoC Bank; provided, however, that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement by the Company that any such modification or change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or information previously provided by the Company was incorrect in any respect. 5.10 Regulatory Applications . (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of Parent cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof and in any event within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult with the other on, all written information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and/or Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the   -55-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ntransactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Party apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby (including promptly furnishing the other with copies of the non-confidential portions of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any third party and/or Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the extent permitted by Law, providing descriptions of any oral communications from such Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to the Company) or a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) require Parent, BoC Bank or the Surviving Corporation or the surviving bank in the Bank Merger to raise additional capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic benefits of the Merger to Parent or the holders of Parent Common Stock (including the Company shareholders in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock received by them in the Merger) (a \u201cMaterially Burdensome Regulatory Condition\u201d). (b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or Governmental Authority. 5.11 Indemnification; Director\u2019s and Officer\u2019s Insurance. (a) Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (each, an \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a \u201cClaim\u201d), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, however, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and observe the obligations of the Company under any agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and officers of the Company for their acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officers or directors.   -56-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. (c) Parent shall or, with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may, purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid \u201ctail\u201d policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 250% of the current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid \u201ctail\u201d policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.11. (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. 5.12 Benefit Plans. (a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (such employees \u201cContinuing Employees\u201d) with a base salary or base wage, cash incentive opportunities and pension and welfare opportunities (excluding equity and long term incentive compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and severance benefits that are the greater of the severance benefits as set forth in Schedule 5.12(a) and any severance benefits that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   -57-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its employee benefit and compensation plans to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any predecessor entities) as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits). (c) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(a), with respect to each Continuing Employee (and their beneficiaries) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which each such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide full credit under medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees (and their beneficiaries) under analogous plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time. (d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing no later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan (the \u201cCompany 401(k) Plan\u201d) to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time; provided, however, that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. As soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time and consistent with the Company 401(k) Plan\u2019s normal distribution procedures, all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive, at their election, a distribution of their entire account balance from the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that a defined contribution qualified retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement established and maintained by Parent or its Affiliates shall accept rollovers of such distributions and participant loans by the Continuing Employees that   -58-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nelect such rollovers from the Company 401(k) Plan. The Parties agree to cooperate as reasonably necessary so as not to place any participant 401(k) loan with respect to a Continuing Employee\u2019s rollover account into default during the period from the Effective Time until the rollover is completed; provided, that such employee continues making loan repayments on a timely basis during such period as may be required to prevent a loan default. (e) To the extent any Benefit Plan limits the amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) in order to preclude such amount from being considered an \u201cexcess parachute payment\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall not waive any such limitation or amend any such Benefit Plan to eliminate or materially alter such limitation. (f) Prior to making any written or oral communications to a broad-based group of the officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are materially affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall (i) be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, contract or practice, or otherwise limit the right of the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates, to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, contract or practice or (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.12. 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. Additionally, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in the event that (i) any Loan not otherwise listed on Schedule 4.02(t)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and which has an aggregate principal balance in excess of $1,000,000 becomes a Criticized Loan or (ii) it charges off any amounts outstanding in respect of any Loan in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or greater. 5.14 Third-Party Agreements. (a) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (in such form and content as mutually agreed by the Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of such third parties (including at Parent\u2019s request, with respect to the termination of Contracts following the Effective Time) to effect a smooth transition in accordance with the Parties\u2019 timetable at or after the Effective Time.   -59-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), each of the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent\u2019s production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time) mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Among other things, the Company shall: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion; (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Company\u2019s outside contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its ongoing needs until the conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to the Company\u2019s personnel and facilities and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors\u2019 personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by Parent. (c) Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 5.15 Closing Financial Statements. At least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall provide Parent with the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements presenting the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations for the period from January 1, 2021 through the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the \u201cClosing Financial Statements\u201d); provided, however, that if the Effective Time of the Merger occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of the month, the Company shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and through the second month preceding the Effective Time of the Merger. Such financial statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting   -60-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nprinciples and other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company\u2019s chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the certificate, the financial condition of the Company in all material respects. Such Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for all Professional Fees incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company\u2019s chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 5.15. 5.16 NASDAQ and NYSE Matters. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the NYSE any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. 5.17 Section 16 Matters.
