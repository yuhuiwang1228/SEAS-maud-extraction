In addition, US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration,.  In addition, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which the holders of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(g) for distributions or dividends, on the Parent Ordinary Shares to which they are entitled to pursuant to Section 3.01(b), with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of the Company Common Stock in exchange for such Parent Ordinary Shares.

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01(b) in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e), and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 3.02(g) upon:  (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate; or (ii) receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares; in each case, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent.  No interest shall be paid or accrued upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book- Entry Share.  Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled. \n\n\n(c)              Investment of Exchange Fund.

To the extent such fund increases for any reason above the level required to make prompt payment of any outstanding Merger Consideration to be paid in exchange for Company Common Stock converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.01(b), Parent, US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall, following such prompt payment, be the sole owners of any amounts left over in such Exchange Fund.  Parent shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owner of any Parent Ordinary Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares held in the Exchange Fund, and Parent shall be subject to Tax on all interest and other income resulting from the investment of such cash.  US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owner of any cash held in the Exchange Fund prior to its disbursement, and shall be subject to Tax on all interest and other income resulting from investments of such cash. \n\n\n(d)              Payments to Non-Registered Holders.  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that:  (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. \n\n\n-26-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)              Full Satisfaction.  All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. \n\n\n(f)              Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. \n\n\n(g)              Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Shares of Company Common Stock.  All Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement.  No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Company Common Stock until the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.06) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.02.  Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole Parent Ordinary Shares issued in exchange for Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 3.02, without interest:  (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares and not paid; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. \n\n\n(h)              Dissenting Shares Merger Consideration.  Any portion of the Cash Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, upon demand. \n\n\n-27-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 3.03          Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder\u2019s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder\u2019s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be.  The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent and US Holdco shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  Except with the prior written consent of Parent and US Holdco, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands. \n\n\nSection 3.04          Adjustments.  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or the Parent Ordinary Shares shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent as permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed to permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. \n\n\nSection 3.05          Withholding Rights.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws.  Amounts so deducted and withheld (and, in the case of the Exchange Agent, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate, paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. \n\n\nSection 3.06          Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent or US Holdco, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or US Holdco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article III. \n\n\n-28-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 3.07          Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Compensation. \n\n\n(a)              Company Stock Options.  Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and be converted into a Parent Share Option, subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting conditions, applicable to such Company Stock Option, to purchase the number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares, at an exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share equal to (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, divided by (y) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole cent; provided that the exercise price, the number of Parent Ordinary Shares and the terms and conditions of such Parent Share Option shall be determined consistent with the applicable requirements for exempt, nonstatutory stock options under Section 409A of the Code. \n\n\n(b)              Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units. \n\n\n(i)      Each award of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Restricted Stock, to be provided to such holder promptly but no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. \n\n\n(ii)      Each award of Company Restricted Stock Units that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and be converted into a number of Parent Restricted Share Units, subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting conditions, applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Units, equal to (i) the number of such Company Restricted Stock Units, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Restricted Share Units. \n\n\n(c)              Company Stock Purchase Plan.  As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company, the Company Board or, as appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plan:  (i) the final exercise date shall be the Closing Date, (ii) each participant\u2019s accumulated contributions under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of such date (provided that participants shall not be permitted to increase their payroll deductions in effect as of the date hereof), and (iii) unless otherwise requested by Parent and US Holdco the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate on such date and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company Stock Purchase Plan.  All shares of Company Common Stock purchased in accordance with this Section 3.07(c) shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. \n\n\n(d)              Assumption of Company Stock Plans. At the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, Parent shall assume all rights and obligations in respect of each Company Stock Plan, including each outstanding Company Equity Award to be converted in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.07 except that:  (i) stock covered by such awards shall be Parent Ordinary Shares; (ii) all references in such Company Stock Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be amended or deemed amended to refer instead to a number of Parent Ordinary Shares determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares; and (iii) the Parent Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Stock Plan.  Parent shall take all actions that are necessary for the assumption of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 3.07, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Ordinary Shares as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.07.  If registration of the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act, Parent shall file with the SEC on the Closing Date a registration statement with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the relevant Company Stock Plans remain in effect and such registration of Parent Ordinary Shares continues to be required. \n\n\n-29-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)              Resolutions and Other Company Actions.  At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board, and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, Parent, the Parent Board and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, and US Holdco, the US Holdco Board and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents) that may be necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.07, including any amendments, conditioned upon, and effective immediately after, the Effective Time, to the Company Stock Plans, Company Stock Purchase Plan or any applicable Parent Share Plans and such other actions as Parent or the Company, as applicable, may reasonably request or require (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as may be necessary or desirable to comply with any requirements of applicable Law or by virtue of the fact that Parent is an Irish public limited company). \n\n\nSection 3.08          Tax Treatment.  The Merger is intended to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as (a) a taxable purchase by Parent of a portion of each share of the outstanding stock of the Company (other than the Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary-Held Shares and the Dissenting Shares) (b) (i) except to the extent that Section 304 of the Code applies, a taxable purchase by US Holdco and (ii) to the extent that Section 304 of the Code applies, an acquisition by US Holdco of a portion of each share of the outstanding stock of the Company (other than the Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary-Held Shares and the Dissenting Shares) and (c) a taxable redemption by the Company of a portion of each share of the outstanding stock of the Company (other than the Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary-Held Shares and the Dissenting Shares). \n\n\nSection 3.09          Closing of Transfer Books.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a given Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such actual or potential Company Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the \u201cCompany Superior Proposal Notice Period\u201d) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Superior Proposal or entering into (or causing one of its Subsidiaries to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to declare a Company Superior Proposal and that it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement in connection with such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), (iii) the Company specifies the identity of the party making the Company Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof in such notice and includes an unredacted copy of the Company Takeover Proposal and attaches to such notice the most current version of any proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and any related documents, including financing documents, to the extent provided by the relevant party in connection with, and containing material terms of, the Company Superior Proposal, (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being understood and agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Company Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price or financing, the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)), and (v) at the conclusion of the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement or otherwise and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law. \n\n\n(e)              Company Intervening Event.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, upon the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n\n(i)      the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a Company Intervening Event has occurred and that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; \n\n\n-78-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(ii)      the Company (A) promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the \u201cCompany Intervening Event Notice Period\u201d) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Intervening Event of its intention to take such action, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Company Intervening Event (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) and (B) prior to making such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by Parent, engages in good faith negotiations with Parent during such three (3) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Company Intervening Event would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Company Board in consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that, if after commencement of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the Company Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder, a new notice to Parent shall be required as provided above; provided, that with respect to each such material change, each reference in this clause (ii) to a \u201cthree (3) Business Day\u201d period shall be changed to refer to a \u201ctwo (2) Business day\u201d period); and \n\n\n(iii)      at the conclusion of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, that in light of such Company Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law. \n\n\nSection 6.03          Company Stockholders Meeting.  The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of such meeting.  Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.02 hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation.  Subject to Section 6.02 hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to:  (a) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; and (b) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval.  The Company shall keep Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub.  Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent and US Holdco (other than: (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders; or (ii) as reasonably determined by the Company to comply with applicable Law).  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Parent Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.  Without the prior written consent of Parent and US Holdco or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.  If the Company Board makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to submit the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. \n\n\n-79-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.04          Financing Cooperation. \n\n\n(a)              Cooperation.

At any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, upon the occurrence of a Parent Intervening Event, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n\n(i)      the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred and that failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the shareholders of Parent under applicable Law; \n\n\n(ii)      Parent (A) promptly notifies the Company, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the \u201cParent Intervening Event Notice Period\u201d) before making a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Parent Intervening Event of its intention to take such action, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Parent Intervening Event (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) and (B) prior to making such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by the Company, engages in good faith negotiations with the Company during such three (3) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Parent Board to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Parent Intervening Event would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Parent Board in consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that, if after commencement of the Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the Parent Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder, a new notice to Parent shall be required as provided above; provided, that with respect to each such material change, each reference in this clause (ii) to a \u201cthree (3) Business Day\u201d period shall be changed to refer to a \u201ctwo (2) Business Day\u201d period); and \n\n\n(iii)      at the conclusion of the Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, that in light of such Parent Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by the Company, the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Parent directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law. \n\n\n-86-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 7.03          Parent Shareholders Meeting; Approval by Sole Stockholders of Merger Sub. \n\n\n(a)              Parent Shareholders Meeting.  Parent shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective, and, in connection therewith, Parent shall mail the \u200bEGM Notice to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares in advance of the Parent Shareholders Meeting.  Except to the extent that the Parent Board shall have effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.02 hereof, the EGM Notice shall include the Parent Board Recommendation.  Subject to Section 7.02 hereof, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to:  (i) solicit from the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares proxies in favor of the approval of granting the Parent Board authority to effect the Parent Share Issuance; and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares required by applicable Law to obtain such approval.  Parent shall keep the Company updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by the Company.  Once the Parent Shareholders Meeting has been called and noticed, Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholders Meeting without the consent of Company (other than:  (A) in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders; or (B) as reasonably determined by Parent to comply with applicable Law).  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Company to hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.  Without the prior written consent of the Company or as required by applicable Law, (i) the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholders Meeting and, prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent shall not submit any other proposal to such shareholders in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting (including any proposal inconsistent with the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except for, following the approval of the grant of authority, any Parent AGM Resolutions proposed to be voted on at a Parent AGM to be called and held on a date subsequent to the Parent Shareholder Meeting (provided that it is acknowledged and agreed that the Parent AGM must be held no later than September 30, 2021, and Parent shall be permitted to take action to call and hold the Parent AGM on such date even if the Requisite Parent Vote has not been obtained) and (ii) prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent shall not call any meeting of the shareholders of Parent other than the Parent Shareholders Meeting.  If the Parent Board makes a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter the obligation of Parent to submit the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares at the Parent Shareholders Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Parent Shareholders Meeting. \n\n\n(b)              Approval by Sole Stockholders.  Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and US Holdco, as sole stockholders of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL. \n\n\nSection 7.04          Benefit Plans. \n\n\n(a)              Termination of Benefit Plans.  Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, solely to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the applicable Company Employee Plan and to the extent that such termination will not trigger a material penalty or result in imposition of additional Tax, other than as a result of the acceleration of recognition of income or deferral of deduction from income, to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any Company Employee, the Company shall terminate any Company Employee Plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries that Parent has requested to be terminated by providing a written notice to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and, no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have been terminated. \n\n\n(b)              Prior Written Consent.  With respect to matters described in this Section 7.04, the Company will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). \n\n\n-87-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 7.05          Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance. \n\n\n(a)              Indemnification.  From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Stock Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (each an \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director or manager of another Person, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (\u201cIndemnified Liabilities\u201d), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to do so by law.  Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation within 90 days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law.  Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Indemnified Party as provided in the Charter Documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.  For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the provisions of the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions by any Indemnified Party occurring prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. \n\n\n(b)              Insurance.  The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to:  (i) obtain and fully prepay as of the Effective Time \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\u2019s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, with respect to the entire six (6)-year period following the Effective Time, premiums for such coverage under this Section 7.05 which in the aggregate exceed 300% percent of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period in its most recent fiscal year for such purpose prior to the date of this Agreement (the \u201cMaximum Premium\u201d).  If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. \n\n\n(c)              Survival.  The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.05 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.05 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.05 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.05, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.05). \n\n\n-88-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d)              Assumptions by Successors and Assigns; No Release or Waiver.  In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns:  (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.  The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to the Charter Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Law, Contract, or otherwise.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors, and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.05 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. \n\n\n(e)              Beneficiaries; Fees.  The provisions of this Section 7.05 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 7.05, and his or her heirs and Representatives.  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.05. \n\n\nSection 7.06          Financing. \n\n\n(a)              No Amendments to Commitment Letter.  Parent will not (without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement, or modification of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to the Commitment Letter if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, or waiver would:  (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the net proceeds of the Debt Financing to an amount that, together with Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s cash on hand and cash equivalents on hand and any Escrowed Take-Out Financing Proceeds, would be less than the Required Amount; (ii) (x) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend, or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or (y) expand, amend or modify any other terms to the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to:  (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, materially less likely to occur; or (iii) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing definitive agreements (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the \u201cRestricted Amendments\u201d); provided, that Parent may (without the consent of the Company) amend, replace, supplement, modify, or waive the Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers, or other Debt Financing Sources that have not executed the Commitment Letter and amend titles, allocations, and the fee arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers, or Debt Financing Sources, if any such amendment would not reasonably be expected to result in a Restricted Amendment.  Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any case, within five (5) Business Days) furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, or waiver relating to the Commitment Letter.  For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction of the commitments for the Debt Financing that is automatic pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter shall not constitute a Restricted Amendment.  Any reference in this Agreement to:  (x) the \u201cDebt Financing\u201d will include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended or modified, and (y) the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d will include such document as so amended or modified.  Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of the other obligations under this Agreement that Parent obtain the Debt Financing, the Take-Out Financing or any other financing for or relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \n\n\n-89-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)              Taking of Necessary Actions.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the right of Parent to amend, replace, supplement, modify, or waive the Commitment Letter subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.06(a)), Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, and advisable to arrange, maintain the effectiveness of, and consummate the Debt Financing in an amount necessary (after giving effect to Parent\u2019s, US Holdco\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s cash on hand, any cash proceeds of any Take-Out Financing received by Parent or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and any Escrowed Take-Out Financing Proceeds) to fund the Required Amount on or prior to the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including, but not limited to, using its commercially reasonable efforts to:  (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof and hereof; (ii) negotiate, execute, and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on a timely basis on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date that are within its control and to comply with all of its obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letter; (iv) upon the satisfaction (or waiver) of all of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing; and (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.  Parent will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Commitment Letter as and when they become due. \n\n\n(c)              Information.  To the extent reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (including providing the Company, upon request, with copies of all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing), and such other information and documentation available to Parent as shall be reasonably requested by the Company (including any information requested in connection with any of the circumstances contemplated by the immediately following sentence).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice as soon as reasonably practicable in writing (and in any case, within two (2) Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following):  (i) of any material breach, material default, termination, or cancellation by any party to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements that Parent becomes aware of, and (ii) of the receipt by Parent of any written notice from any Debt Financing Source with respect to:  (A) any breach, default, termination, or cancellation by any party to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements; or (B) any material dispute or material disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing. \n\n\n(d)              Alternative Financing.  In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange and obtain financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing that is required to fund the Required Amount on terms, conditions, and cost not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent; provided, that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not include requiring Parent to pay any additional fees applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of the amount set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (or any related side fee letter) or obtain financing on terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to Parent than those in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter; provided, further, that any such alternative debt financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company have terms or conditions that would result in a Restricted Amendment if such terms or conditions were an amendment to the Commitment Letter or the terms and conditions to the Debt Financing (the \u201cAlternative Financing\u201d).  The provisions of this Section 7.06 shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing. \n\n\n-90-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 7.07          Parent Board Representation.  Parent shall take all reasonably necessary actions to cause, as of the Closing, Colin Shannon to be appointed to the Parent Board until the next Parent AGM in accordance with and subject to Parent\u2019s Charter Documents, Parent\u2019s governance policies and applicable Law. In addition, Parent, through the Parent Board and its Nominating & Governance Committee, agrees to take all reasonably necessary actions to cause, as of the Closing, one additional current member of the Company Board (such member to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) to be appointed to the Parent Board until the next Parent AGM in accordance with and subject to Parent\u2019s Charter Documents, Parent\u2019s governance policies and applicable Law. Parent, through the Parent Board and its Nominating & Governance Committee (as applicable), shall take all reasonably necessary actions to nominate such two new directors for re-election to the Parent Board at the next Parent AGM after Closing in accordance with and subject to Parent\u2019s Charter Documents, Parent\u2019s governance policies and applicable Law. \n\n\nSection 7.08          Obligations of Merger Sub and US Holdco.

If the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 10.06, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party makes a claim against the non-paying party that results in a judgment, the non-paying party shall pay to the other party the reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 10.06 at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.  For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made (or caused to be made by a Subsidiary) by the Company, Parent or US Holdco under this Section 10.06 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 10.06 and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more provision hereof.  Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent and US Holdco Expenses by the Company or the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee or Company Expenses by Parent and/or US Holdco, as applicable, is not a penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.  The parties to this Agreement agree that the monetary remedies set forth in this Section 10.06 and the specific performance remedies set forth in Section 11.12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of Parent in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation; and (ii) Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of the Company in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation. \n\n\n(d)              Except as expressly set forth in this Section 10.06, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses.  If Parent and US Holdco receive the Company Termination Fee, then Parent and US Holdco will not be entitled to also receive a payment of the Parent and US Holdco Expenses; upon payment of any Company Termination Fee, any previously paid Parent and US Holdco Expenses shall be credited against the amount of the Company Termination Fee.  In no event shall the Company be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee or more than one payment of the Company Expenses.  If the Company receives the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee, then the Company will not be entitled to also receive a payment of the Company Expenses; upon payment of any Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee, any previously paid Company Expenses shall be credited against the amount of the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee. \n\n\n-106-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company for any reason at a time when Parent and US Holdco would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, Parent and US Holdco shall be entitled to receipt of any Company Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent and US Holdco terminated this Agreement at such time, and (ii) Parent and US Holdco for any reason at a time when the Company would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to receipt of any Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had the Company terminated this Agreement at such time. \n\n\nSection 10.07          Amendment.  Subject to Section 11.13, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote, by written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that:  (a) following the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock without such approval; and (b) following the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares without such approval. \n\n\nSection 10.08          Extension; Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may:  (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party(ies); (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this Agreement; or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements, or conditions contained in this Agreement.  Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party.  The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. \n\n\n-107-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nARTICLE XI \n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS \n\n\nSection 11.01          Interpretation; Construction. \n\n\n(a)              The words \u201chereof,\u201d \u201cherein,\u201d \u201chereto\u201d and \u201chereunder\u201d and words of like import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

In addition, in no event will any Debt Financing Related Party be liable to the Company or its Subsidiaries for any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business, or anticipated savings), or damages of a tortious nature in connection with the Debt Financing.

This Section 11.13 shall, with respect to the matters referenced herein, supersede any provision of this Agreement to the contrary. \n\n\nSection 11.14          No Recourse.

THE OFFER 1.1 The Offer. (a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, promptly after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Sections 1.1(e) and 1.2(b)), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Sections 2.5(a)(i) and 2.5(a)(ii) (collectively, the \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.6(e). (b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the \u201cOffer Conditions\u201d). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d) that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nAgreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clauses (d) or (f) of Annex I, (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, or that would or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair, prevent or materially delay Parent\u2019s or Purchaser\u2019s ability to consummate the Transactions in a timely manner, (G) terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, in each case, except as provided in Sections 1.1(c) or 1.1(d) or (H) provide any \u201csubsequent offering period\u201d (or any extension thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8. (c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the date that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) from the Offer Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the \u201cInitial Expiration Date\u201d, and such date or such subsequent date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the \u201cExpiration Date\u201d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties\u2019 respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the \u201cExtension Deadline\u201d); or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer, or permit the Offer to expire, prior to the Expiration Date or the earlier valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 without the prior written consent of the Company.     3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.1 shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. (e) Offer Documents. Promptly on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, including the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal, the \u201cOffer Documents\u201d) that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parent\u2019s legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders that may be required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or as reasonably requested in order to comply with the actions contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. (f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.11, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis (and in any event prior to the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date), all of the funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchaser\u2019s obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.     4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(g) Adjustments.

No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.6(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (with respect to the Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving   10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCorporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration, that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

Each such withholding agent shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such payor shall request such information from such payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation, which the Parties agree shall be satisfied by the provision of the letter of transmittal described in Section 1.1(e) Section 2.6(b), as applicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants or other recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder, claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.   11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n2.7 Dissenters\u2019 Rights.

The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER Parent and Purchaser hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 4.1 Due Organization. Parent is a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) and Purchaser is a corporation, in each case duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) and has all necessary power and authority: (a) to conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted; (b) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used; and (c) to perform its obligations under all Contracts by which it is bound, except for any such failure that would not have, and would not reasonably   28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nbe expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Purchaser is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation or other Entity, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has either delivered or made available to Company or Company\u2019s Representatives accurate and complete copies of Parent\u2019s articles of association (Satzung), the rules of procedure of the Parent Supervisory Board, and rules of procedure of the Parent Management Board and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser as in effect as of the date hereof. 4.2 Purchaser. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and activities incidental thereto and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the Transactions and those incident to Purchaser\u2019s formation. A wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances and transfer restrictions, except for Permitted Encumbrances. 4.3 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Parent and Purchaser have the corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver and to perform their obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions; and the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Parent Management Board, the Parent Supervisory Board and the board of directors of Purchaser. The Parent Management Board and the Parent Supervisory Board (at meetings duly called and held) have (a) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interest of, Parent and its shareholders; (b) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement; and (c) approved the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions; which resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have not been subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to the Company. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, is enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to the GSCA, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditor\u2019s rights, and by general equitable principles. 4.4 Non-Contravention; Consents. (a) Assuming compliance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the GSCA, the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and FSE, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, and the consummation of the Transactions, will not: (i) cause a violation of any of the provisions of Parent\u2019s articles of association (Satzung), the rules of procedure of the Parent Supervisory Board, or rules of procedure of the Parent Management Board or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser; (ii) cause a violation by Parent or Purchaser of any Legal Requirement or order applicable to Parent or Purchaser, or to which they are subject; or (iii) conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of purchase, termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation under, any Contract to which Parent or Purchaser are party or bound by, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), as would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.     29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Except as may be required by the Exchange Act (including the filing with the SEC of the Offer Documents), state Takeover Laws, the DGCL, the GSCA, the HSR Act and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and FSE, neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of Parent\u2019s other Affiliates, is required to give notice to, make any filing with or obtain any consent from any Governmental Body at any time prior to the Closing in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser or the consummation by Parent or Purchaser of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, except those filings, notices or consents the failure to make, obtain or receive would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No vote of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required (by Legal Requirements, the organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded) to approve this Agreement or consummate any of the Transactions. 4.5 Information Supplied.

The Offer Documents (except for such portions thereof that relate only to the Company or any of the Acquired Corporations) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 4.6 Legal Proceedings; Orders. There is no Legal Proceeding pending and served (or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, pending and not served or overtly threatened) against Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, against any present or former officer, director or employee of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except as would not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, as of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Purchaser nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or continuing investigation by, any Governmental Body, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Body, except as would not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 4.7 Funds; Valid Issuance. At the Offer Acceptance Time and Closing Date, as applicable, Parent will have available sufficient cash resources (including the proceeds of the Financing), marketable securities and available lines of credit necessary to consummate the Transactions on the terms contemplated in this Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n4.8 Ownership of Shares. Neither Parent nor any of Parent\u2019s Affiliates directly or indirectly owns, and at all times for the past three (3) years, neither Parent nor any of Parent\u2019s controlled Affiliates has owned, beneficially or otherwise, any shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock or any securities, Contracts or obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock.

Accordingly, Parent and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Acquired Corporations nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, nor any other person, has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans.   31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n4.10 Brokers and Other Advisors.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of each of the fully executed Royalty Purchase Agreement and Revenue Participation Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among the Financing Sources party thereto and the Parent (together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the \u201cRoyalty Purchase Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, the Financing Sources party thereto have agreed to purchase certain royalty streams of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries in consideration of the purchase prices set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements and aggregating not less than $1,425,000,000 in cash (the \u201cFinancing\u201d). (b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Royalty Purchase Agreements are in full force and effect and constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against the Parent in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\u2019 rights, and by general equitable principles.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Royalty Purchase Agreements have not been amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained in the Royalty Purchase Agreements have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto. Parent is not in default or material breach under the terms and conditions of any Royalty Purchase Agreement and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or material breach by Parent or a failure to satisfy a condition of Parent under the terms and conditions of any Royalty Purchase Agreement.

(e) There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to any Royalty Purchase Agreement or the Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability,   32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nconditionality, enforceability, termination or amount of Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements in any material respect. Parent or an Affiliate of Parent on its behalf has fully paid any and all fees and other amounts required by the Royalty Purchase Agreements to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. (f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing and the closing of the Royalty Purchase Agreements) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent hereunder. (g) No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries). Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, assuming that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Closing and the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the transactions set forth herein, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

Solely for purposes of integration planning and Parent\u2019s monitoring of the Acquired Corporation\u2019s cash position and compliance with Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of this Agreement, the Acquired Corporations shall reasonably consult with Parent in respect of such matters, and use reasonable best efforts to (i) provide Parent with written cash management reports each week describing the Acquired Corporations\u2019 cash position and use of cash for the prior week and a cash forecast for the succeeding week, and such other related information as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) participate in discussions weekly, or as otherwise reasonably requested by Parent to review any such cash management reports and cash forecasts; provided, that such cash management reports, cash forecasts or other related information and such discussions shall be provided for disclosure purposes only and not be deemed to broaden or narrow any the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall require any of the Acquired Corporations to disclose any information to Parent or afford any access to Parent if: (i) such disclosure or access would, in the Company\u2019s good-faith discretion with the advice of legal counsel (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (y) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which an Acquired Corporation or its Affiliate is a party); or (ii) such information relates to the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board or its committees where the Company Board or any applicable committee discussed the Transactions or any similar transaction between the Company and any other Person (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company Board, whether in connection with a specific meeting, or otherwise relating to such subject matter). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to the other pursuant to this Section 5.1 to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties. To the extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws, information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent. With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct Parent\u2019s Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement dated November 20, 2020, as amended April 14, 2021, between the Company and Parent (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Acquired Corporations may satisfy their obligations set forth above to provide access to personnel, assets, books, records, work papers and any other documents and information by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under the applicable Legal Requirements (including any COVID-19 Measures).   34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n5.2 Operation of the Acquired Corporations\u2019 Business.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 6.1 Company Board Recommendation; Termination. (a) Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section 6.1(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a \u201cCompany Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d) or (ii) allow the Company to execute or enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, merger agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).   39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time: (i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, in each case, if: (A) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), including, if not already provided, providing to Parent the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination (a \u201cDetermination Notice\u201d) (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination); and (B) at the end of the three (3) business-day period following the provision of the Determination Notice, after giving effect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent or any other proposals irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to such Determination Notice, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer. Issuance of any \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three (3) business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days; and (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change in Circumstance, if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\u2019s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice, specifying the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (C) at the end of the three (3) business-day period following the provision of the Determination Notice, after giving effect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent or any other proposals irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to such Determination Notice, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Change in Circumstance would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements.   40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals. (a) Each of the Parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements, including applicable Antitrust Laws, to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any Antitrust Law; and (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions. (b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2, the Parties agree to promptly take, and cause their Affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under any Antitrust Law, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or materially delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond the End Date, including (i) negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines, assets, or Intellectual Property of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with respect to the entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines, assets, or Intellectual Property of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, however, that the Parties shall not be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction that would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Parent and the Acquired Corporations on a combined basis and provided further that the Company and the Acquired Corporations shall not be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, unless such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company and the Acquired Corporations only in the event the Closing occurs. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date; provided that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent to take all actions and steps to eliminate each and every impediment identified herein.     41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all notification and report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and promptly make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be required to be made or obtained by such Party under any other Antitrust Laws; and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings, notifications or other consents that are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions or from any Persons with respect to the contracts set forth on Schedule 3.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including allowing the other Parties to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions; (iii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (v) promptly furnish to the other Parties, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (vi) consult in advance and cooperate with the other Party and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, except that each Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the other Party as \u201cOutside Counsel Only Material,\u201d and also may redact the material as necessary to (A) remove competitively sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning valuation, (C) comply with contractual arrangements, (D) address legal privilege, or (E) comply with applicable Legal Requirements; and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other Parties to be present at each meeting, teleconference or videoconference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable such information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other materials received by any Party or any of its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the Transactions. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or withdraw any notification filed under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other.   42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e) Prior to Closing, without the prior written approval of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not effect or agree to any business combination (whether structured as a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any person that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 6.3 Employee Benefits. (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the \u201cContinuation Period\u201d), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of an Acquired Corporation who is employed by an Acquired Corporation as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one (1)-year period (each, a \u201cContinuing Employee\u201d) (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that provided to such Continuing Employee by the applicable Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash incentive compensation opportunity with respect to fiscal year 2022 that is no less favorable than that provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) other employee benefits that in the aggregate are no less favorable than either (A) those provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) those provided to similarly situated Parent Employees employed in the United States. In addition, with respect to fiscal year 2022 (commencing with the annual grants to be made in April 2022), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with an annual equity incentive compensation opportunity that is comparable to that provided to similarly situated United States employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. (b) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual under any compensation or benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates in which a Continuing Employee participates following the Effective Time (but not for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan), Parent shall ensure that such compensation or benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, credit each Continuing Employee for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan; provided that such service is not required to be recognized solely to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Following the Effective Time, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall, with respect to each Continuing Employee, (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent that provides health benefits in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by such Continuing Employee and   43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nhis or her eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent during the portion of the calendar year prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time. (c) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each employee who, (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, is employed by an Acquired Corporation and is eligible to participate in a 2021 annual bonus program of an Acquired Corporation, and (2) remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate on the date such annual bonus would be payable pursuant to the Company\u2019s ordinary course payment schedule (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be later than March 15, 2022), an annual bonus payment with respect to 2021, which bonus payment shall be equal to such employee\u2019s target annual bonus for 2021. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.3 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be \u201cat will\u201d employment. 6.4 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation and any indemnification or other similar agreements of any Acquired Corporation, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to perform their obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person (the \u201cIndemnified Persons\u201d), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective   44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nTime, including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with the organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019 certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any such indemnification or other similar agreements, as applicable, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having at least an \u201cA\u201d rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Acquired Corporations (the \u201cMaximum Amount\u201d). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.4(b) because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase a \u201ctail\u201d directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.     45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent\u2019s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 (i) shall survive the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.4 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person. 6.5 Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the valid termination of this Agreement, the Company shall control the defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions (whether directly or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations or otherwise); provided, however, that the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation, and the Company shall consult with Parent prior to the settlement, release, waiver or compromise of any such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account, and no such settlement, release, waiver or compromise of such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent\u2019s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that no prior written consent is required to the extent the settlement is fully covered by the Company\u2019s insurance policies (other than any applicable deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in the imposition of any restriction on the business or operations of the Company. 6.6 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the provisions of Section 5.3, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions and (b) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger brought by any third Person against such Party.   46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.7 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s), public disclosure, statement or announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release, public statement or announcement without the other Party\u2019s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in publicly available conference calls and in the Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures, statements or announcements made jointly by the parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party (except Parent shall not be obligated to give advance notice in the event of an ad hoc release pursuant Article 17 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation)), issue any such press release or make any such public disclosure, statement or announcement as may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent or obtain its consent in connection with any press release, public disclosure, statement or announcement contemplated, permitted or required pursuant to Section 5.3, Section 6.1 or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Change in Circumstance. 6.8 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company and the Parent Management Board, the Parent Supervisory Board, and each of Purchaser\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective boards of directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions. 6.9 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Company Board (or a duly formed committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)), shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares, and Company Options in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 6.10 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the compensation committee of the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, will approve, as an \u201cemployment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement\u201d within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between an Acquired Corporation or any of its Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Acquired Corporations that are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and will take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.   47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.11 Obligations of Parent. Parent shall cause Purchaser and each of Parent\u2019s other Subsidiaries, and the Surviving Corporation, to comply with, duly perform, satisfy and discharge on a timely basis, all of their respective covenants, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with its Subsidiaries for the due and timely performance, satisfaction and discharge of each of said covenants, obligations and liabilities. Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of MorphoSys US Inc. shall cause MorphoSys US Inc., in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser, to approve and adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following its execution. 6.12 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Parent shall cause (and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to cause) the Surviving Corporation\u2019s securities to be de-listed from NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. 6.13 Company Warrants. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide the holder of each Company Warrant with written notice of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrants. 6.14 Parent Financing. (a) Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain funds sufficient to fund any amount payable by Parent or Purchaser (or either of their respective Affiliates) in connection with the Transactions, including the payment of all of Parent\u2019s, Purchaser\u2019s and their respective Affiliates\u2019 costs and expenses incurred in the evaluation, negotiation and execution of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, unless, and to the extent Parent shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that Parent shall have readily available to it sufficient cash from other financing sources (including by reason of capital markets, securities, other financing transactions or Alternative Financing), Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements (including, in the event all conditions contained in any Royalty Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, using reasonable best efforts to (x) cause the Financing Sources to comply with their respective obligations, and (y) comply with its obligations and enforce its rights under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, in each case, in a timely and diligent manner) on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to:     48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(i) maintain in effect the Royalty Purchase Agreements and comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis, and in a manner that will not impede the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions promptly upon the Closing Date, all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements. Parent shall (A) upon reasonable request, keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of Parent\u2019s efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements and any other financing, (B) give the Company prompt notice of (x) any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements or (y) any default, termination, cancellation, breach or threatened in writing breach by any party to the Royalty Purchase Agreements of which Parent has become aware and (C) provide to the Company correct and executed copies of any material agreements entered into prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Financing. (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Royalty Purchase Agreements without the Company\u2019s prior written consent; provided that Parent may, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Royalty Purchase Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated by the applicable Royalty Purchase Agreement, (B) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the Royalty Purchase Agreements, in each case, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Royalty Purchase Agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or (C) otherwise prevent, delay in any material respect or impede the consummation of the Transactions or the Financing, including without limitation by imposing new or additional conditions precedent or expanding any existing condition precedent to the receipt and availability of the Financing. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver, the term \u201cRoyalty Purchase Agreement\u201d shall include the applicable Royalty Purchase Agreement, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of any Royalty Purchase Agreement and/or any such waiver of a provision of any Royalty Purchase Agreement. (c) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, or any Royalty Purchase Agreement is withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, regardless of the reason therefor, then Parent shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount sufficient, when taken together with cash on hand readily available to Parent (as demonstrated by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay any amounts due from Parent under this Agreement and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative financing that are more onerous, when taken as a whole, than the conditions set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, and   49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason for such unavailability. \n\n\nIn the event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 6.14(c) (\u201cAlternative Financing\u201d), references in this Agreement to the \u201cFinancing\u201d shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more purchase or sale agreements, commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this Agreement to the \u201cRoyalty Purchase Agreements\u201d shall also be deemed to refer to such purchase or sale agreements, commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent\u2019s obligations with respect to the Financing. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of Parent\u2019s obligations hereunder. \n\n\nSECTION 7. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER The obligations of the Parties to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver as of the Closing of each of the following conditions: 7.1 No Restraints. There shall not have been issued by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations, and remain in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger, nor shall there be any Legal Requirement promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations which prohibits, or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that no Party shall be permitted to invoke this Section 7.1 unless it shall have taken all actions required under this Agreement to have any such order lifted. 7.2 Consummation of Offer. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchaser\u2019s behalf) shall have accepted for payment all of the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not validly withdrawn.     50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n7.3 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7 or Annex I to be satisfied if such failure was proximately caused by the failure of such Party to perform any of its covenants, obligations or agreements under this Agreement. \n\n\nSECTION 8. TERMINATION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time (or prior to such earlier time as set forth in this Section 8.1): (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time;

provided, however, that (x) if as of the End Date the conditions set forth in clause (d) or (f) of Annex I (in the case of (f), solely with respect to an order, injunction or Legal Requirement relating to Antitrust Laws), shall not have been satisfied or validly waived by Parent or Purchaser, to the extent waivable in accordance with this Agreement and applicable Legal Requirements by Parent or Purchaser, then the End Date shall automatically be extended one (1) time (but no more than one (1) time) by a period of ninety (90) calendar days (and all references to the End Date herein and in Annex I shall be as so extended); and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose material breach of this Agreement has caused or resulted in the Offer not being consummated by such date; (c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose material breach of this Agreement has caused or resulted in such final and non-appealable order, decree, ruling or other action or that has failed to comply with its obligations under Section 6.2 with respect to the removal of such order, injunction decree, ruling or other action;

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction (or series of related transactions) which the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, constitutes a Superior Offer (a \u201cSpecified Agreement\u201d) in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(i);     51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that the conditions set forth in clause (b) or (c) of Annex I would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or failure to perform; provided, however, that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if either Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured; (g) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case, if such breach or failure would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and such breach or failure cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform;

Solely with respect to the rights of the Financing Sources, this Section 8.2 may not be amended, altered, waived or repealed without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.   52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.2 and this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9. (b) In the event that: (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e); (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); or (iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to Section 8.1(b)) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) resulting from a willful and material breach of Section 5.3, (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination and such Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such termination and (z) within six (6) months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such six (6)-month period) or consummated an Acquisition Proposal; provided that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to \u201c20%\u201d in the definition of \u201cAcquisition Proposal\u201d shall be deemed to be references to \u201c50%\u201d; \n\n\nthen, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on the date that the Specified Agreement is executed (or if the Specified Agreement is executed on a day that is not a business day, the next business day), (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within three (3) business days after such termination or (z) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(iii), within two (2) business days following the Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, \u201cTermination Fee\u201d shall mean $60,000,000 in cash. Acceptance by Parent of the Termination Fee shall constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1(e). Payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, \u201cParent Related Parties\u201d) or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.   53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c) Except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach, Parent\u2019s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Acquired Corporations and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, employees, partners, stockholders, option holders, managers, members, other Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, \u201cCompany Related Parties\u201d) for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without those agreements, the Company, Parent and Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to make payment of any amount payable under Section 8.3(b) within the applicable time period specified in Section 8.3(b), as the case may be, and Parent commences a Legal Proceeding to collect such amount that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall reimburse Parent for its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Legal Proceeding and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the amount was payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), with such interest to accrue beginning on the date such amount first was payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), to the date of payment. \n\n\nSECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.4(d), this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the Company Board and the Parent Management Board and the Parent Supervisory Board, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto. 9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

This Agreement and the other agreements and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; provided, further, that, if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any Legal Proceeding between or among the Parties or their Affiliates arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, each of the Parties (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only if) such court declines jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties); (ii) irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.9 (provided that nothing in this Section 9.5(a) shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements); and (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court. (b) The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party\u2019s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.   55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement or at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the Company, on behalf of itself and any third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement) have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(c) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any Party brings any Legal Proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 9.5(a), to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (A) the amount of time during which such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) business days or (B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding, as the case may be. (d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence and that the Parties would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms, including but not limited to as a result of any dispute over the Parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that, as to any Legal Proceedings in which a Party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9.5(c) of this Agreement, the Parties shall use their best efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and shall not oppose any Party\u2019s request for expedited proceedings. (e) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.5(e).   56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall be void and of no effect. 9.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs (A) the right of the Company\u2019s stockholders to receive the Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 1 or Section 2 following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without limitation to the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have the right, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages against Parent and/or Purchaser for the loss of the Offer Price and Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of the Offer and the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to each such holder) in the event of any material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser. 9.8 Transfer Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.1(i) and Section 2.6(b), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees imposed with respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be borne by the Company, Parent or Purchaser and expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares. 9.9 Notices.

RECITALS A.    The parties to this Agreement desire to effect a merger of the Company with and into Nicolet (the \u201cMerger\u201d) in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the WBCL and the MBCA, with Nicolet as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the \u201cSurviving Entity\u201d). B.    The respective boards of directors of the Company and Nicolet have approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL and the MBCA, approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement and determined that consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders. C.    The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. D.    The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the parties also agree to certain prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions. AGREEMENTS In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises, covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows: \n\n\nARTICLE 1 THE MERGER \n\n\nSection 1.1    The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL and the MBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Nicolet pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the WBCL and the MBCA, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Nicolet will be the Surviving Entity. Section 1.2    Effective Time; Closing. (a)    The closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d) shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually acceptable to Nicolet and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the offices of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, 1201 W. Peachtree Street, 14  Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Nicolet and the Company may agree in writing (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d). Subject to the provisions of Article 10, failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement. (b)    The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (the \u201cArticles of Merger\u201d) and a certificate of merger with the Michigan \n\n\nth \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nDepartment of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Articles of Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). Section 1.3    Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of the WBCL and the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity. Section 1.4    Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity. The Nicolet Articles of Incorporation and the Nicolet Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements. Section 1.5    Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity. At the Effective Time, the directors shall be the directors of Nicolet immediately prior to the Effective Time and one (1) person from the Company Board, to be designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Nicolet prior to the Effective Time (such person from the Company Board is expected to be Paul D. Tobias) (the \u201cCompany Director\u201d). At the Effective Time, the executive officers of the Surviving Entity shall be the executive officers of Nicolet immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such directors and executive officers shall serve until their resignation, removal or until their successors shall have been elected or appointed and shall have qualified in accordance with the laws and governing documents applicable to Nicolet or Nicolet Bank. Section 1.6    Location of the Surviving Entity. The principal offices of the Surviving Entity will be located at 111 N. Washington Street, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. Section 1.7    Bank Merger. Following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Bank shall be merged with and into Nicolet Bank in accordance with the provisions of the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 215a), Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Article 6 of Chapter 487 of the Michigan Compiled Laws and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan of Merger by and between Nicolet Bank and the Bank, a form of which is attached as Exhibit A (the \u201cBank Plan of Merger\u201d). Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will cause the Bank, and Nicolet will cause Nicolet Bank, to execute and deliver the Bank Plan of Merger substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A. Section 1.8    Absence of Control. Subject to any specific provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither Nicolet nor the Company by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed (until consummation of the Merger) to control, directly or indirectly, the other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries and shall not exercise, or be deemed to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of such other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries. Section 1.9    Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Nicolet may change the method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that it concludes such a change to be desirable; provided, that: (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger or (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger. If Nicolet elects to make such a change, the parties shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. ARTICLE 2 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER \n\n\nSection 2.1    Consideration. (a)    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nStock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted, subject to the fractional share procedures in Section 2.4 and the dissenters rights provisions in Section 2.5, into the right to receive: (i)    0.22 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d) of Nicolet Common Stock (the \u201cPer Share Stock Consideration\u201d), and (ii)    $4.64 in cash, without interest (the \u201cPer Share Cash Consideration\u201d). (b)    The total cash and stock consideration to be paid by Nicolet in respect of shares of Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the \u201cMerger Consideration.\u201d Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in the Company\u2019s treasury and each share of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Nicolet (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted) will be cancelled and no shares of Nicolet Common Stock, cash, or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. Section 2.2    Exchange of Company Stock Certificates. (a)    The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to customary terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Nicolet shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. (b)    At or prior to the Effective Time, Nicolet shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock and cash for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.4. Such amount of cash and shares of Nicolet Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the \u201cConversion Fund.\u201d (c)    Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Nicolet shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates or evidence of book-entry representing such shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCompany Stock Certificates\u201d) the letter of transmittal and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) (the \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d ) for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement. (d)    Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. (e)    No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate. (f)    After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of Outstanding Company Shares on the stock transfer books of the Company. (g)    No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Nicolet Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nthereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which such holder\u2019s Company Common Stock shall have been converted. (h)    Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest, for issuance of Nicolet Common Stock and/or cash pursuant to the Merger Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such shareholders\u2019 shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Nicolet Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (i)    In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this Article 2, shares of Nicolet Common Stock and/or cash pursuant to the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. (j)    If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration per share shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Section 2.3    Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Company Stock Certificates that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock or cash into which they were converted pursuant to this Article 2. Section 2.4    No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying Nicolet Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled. Section 2.5    Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 2 to the contrary, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted in the Merger. All dissenting shares shall be cancelled, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Chapter 450 Section 1762 of the MBCA; provided, however, that if any such shareholder fails to perfect his, her or its rights as a dissenting shareholder with respect to his, her or its Dissenting Shares in accordance with Chapter 450 of the MBCA or withdraws or loses such holder\u2019s dissenter\u2019s rights, such shares held by such shareholder shall be deemed to have been converted into, and become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such shares would have been entitled as of the Effective Time, without interest thereon. Section 2.6    Nicolet Common Stock.

The Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (b)    The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the \u201cCompany Financial Statements\u201d) are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Company Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Company Financial Statements. The Company Financial Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the Company Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As of the date hereof, Plante & Moran, PLLC has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public accountant of the Company.

As of December 31, 2020, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. (d)    The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) (\u201cInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\u201d). The Company\u2019s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or annual report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter, under the \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nExchange Act (the \u201cCompany Evaluation Date\u201d). The Company presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Company Evaluation Date. Since the Company Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in the Company\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\u2019s general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\u2019s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

The Company Regulatory Reports have been prepared in material compliance with the rules and regulations of the respective federal or state banking regulator with which they were filed, except as otherwise noted therein.

None of the Company Regulatory Reports contains any material items of special or nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the Ordinary Course of Business (it being understood that income relating to the Paycheck Protection Program is deemed earned in the Ordinary Course), except as expressly specified therein.  (f)    Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2019, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. (g)    Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Authority has initiated since January 1, 2019, or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of the Company or the Bank. Since January 1, 2019, no Regulatory Authority has resolved any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of the Company or the Bank. The Company and its Subsidiaries have fully complied with, and there is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to, any report or statement relating to any examination or inspection of the Company or the Bank. Since January 1, 2019, there have been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Authority with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of the Company or the Bank (other than normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in the Company\u2019s Ordinary Course of Business). To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2019 that would result in a determination that the Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 303.2(r).

None of the Company\u2019s systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their accountants, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been advised of any material deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management. No material weakness in internal controls has been identified by the Company\u2019s auditors, and there have been no significant changes in internal controls that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect internal controls. The minute books of the Company and its Subsidiaries contain accurate and complete records in all material respects of all meetings held of, and corporate action taken by, its respective shareholders, boards of directors and committees of the boards of directors. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Section 3.9    Properties.

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the lessor. All buildings and structures owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries lie wholly within the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by it, and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights of, any other Person. Section 3.10    Loans; Loan Loss Reserve. (a)    Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof (the \u201cCompany Loans\u201d) reflected as an asset on any of the Company Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines. \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)    All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of the Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Bank.

(e)    Upon written request by an Indemnified Party who has been made party to an Indemnification Proceeding, Nicolet shall reimburse the Expenses of such Indemnified Party as incurred if the Indemnified Party provides Nicolet with all of the following: (1) a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she did not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to the Company and (2) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay to Nicolet such reimbursements if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement. \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)    Upon written request by an Indemnified Employee who has been made party to an Indemnification Proceeding, Nicolet may reimburse the Expenses of such Indemnified Employee as incurred if the Indemnified Employee provides Nicolet with all of the following: (1) a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she did not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to the Company or to any Subsidiary of the Company and (2) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay to Nicolet such reimbursements if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Employee was not entitled to indemnification for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement.

(c)    In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Nicolet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date \n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ncollectively, the \u201cOld Plans\u201d); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out- of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

This Voting and Support Agreement relates to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2021 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), between the Company and Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (\u201cNicolet\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will be merged into and with Nicolet (the \u201cMerger\u201d), and the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) will be converted into and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Agreement. This Voting and Support Agreement represents an agreement between the undersigned and Nicolet regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned in connection with the Merger. \n\n\n    In consideration of the execution and delivery by Nicolet of the Agreement and the mutual covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein and therein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned and Nicolet, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: \n\n\n    1.    Vote on the Merger.  The undersigned agrees to vote all shares of Company Common Stock that the undersigned owns beneficially or of record in favor of approving the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, unless Nicolet is then in breach or default in any material respect as regards any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty as to it contained in the Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to require the undersigned to vote any shares of Company Common Stock over which the undersigned has or shares voting power solely in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of any person, if the undersigned determines, in good faith after consultation with legal counsel, that such a vote would cause a breach of fiduciary duty to such other person. \n\n\n    2.    Restriction on Transfer.  The undersigned further agrees that the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Nicolet, transfer any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, each such term as set forth in the Agreement, except (a) by operation of law, (b) by will, (c) under the laws of descent and distribution, (d) with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, for any sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions necessitated by hardship, or (e) as Nicolet may otherwise agree in writing. \n\n\n    3.    No Agreement as Director or Officer.  The undersigned makes no agreement or understanding in this Voting and Support Agreement in the undersigned\u2019s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and nothing in this Voting and Support Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the undersigned in the undersigned\u2019s capacity as such a director or officer, including exercising rights under the Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Voting and Support Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the undersigned from exercising the undersigned\u2019s fiduciary duties as an officer or director to the Company or its shareholders. \n\n\n    4.    Miscellaneous. This Voting and Support Agreement is the complete agreement between Nicolet and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof.

For avoidance of doubt, a decline in Nicolet\u2019s stock price shall not be considered a reduction in the merger consideration. \n\n\n6.    Capitalized Terms .

TCF Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation (\u201cTCF\u201d). W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Huntington and TCF have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which TCF will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Huntington (the \u201cMerger\u201d), so that Huntington is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d); WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I \n\n\nTHE MERGER \n\n\n1.1  The Merger.    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Laws, as amended (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) and the Michigan Business Corporation Act, as amended (the \u201cMBCA\u201d), at the Effective Time, TCF shall merge with and into Huntington. Huntington shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Maryland. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of TCF shall terminate. 1.2  Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d) will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, remotely via the electronic exchange of closing deliveries, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Huntington and TCF. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the \u201cClosing Date\u201d. \n\n\n-1-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n1.3  Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, Huntington shall cause to be filed articles of merger (the \u201cArticles of Merger\u201d) as provided under the MGCL with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the \u201cMaryland Department\u201d) and a certificate of merger (the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d) as provided under the MBCA with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (the \u201cMichigan Department\u201d). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MGCL and the MBCA, or at such other date and time as shall be provided by applicable law (such date and time, the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). \n\n\n1.4  Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL and the MBCA and this Agreement. \n\n\n1.5  Conversion of TCF Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Huntington, TCF, or the holder of any of the following securities: \n\n\n(a)  Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of TCF issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (\u201cTCF Common Stock\u201d), except for shares of TCF Common Stock owned by TCF or Huntington (in each case other than shares of TCF Common Stock (i) held in any TCF Benefit Plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity and (ii) held, directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted (collectively, the \u201cException Shares\u201d)) shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, 3.0028 shares (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d and such shares, the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d) of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Huntington (the \u201cHuntington Common Stock\u201d). \n\n\n(b) All of the shares of TCF Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an \u201cOld Certificate,\u201d it being understood that any reference herein to \u201cOld Certificate\u201d shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of TCF Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of TCF Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of a fractional share which the shares of TCF Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, in each case without any interest thereon. Old Certificates previously representing shares of TCF Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at Huntington\u2019s option, evidence of shares in book entry form representing whole shares of Huntington Common Stock as set forth in Section 1.5(a) (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Huntington Common Stock or TCF Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or \n\n\n-2-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nkind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give holders of TCF Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit Huntington or TCF to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. \n\n\n(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of TCF Common Stock that are owned by TCF or Huntington (in each case other than the Exception Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. \n\n\n1.6  TCF Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Huntington, TCF or any holder of securities thereof, each share of 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, no par value, of TCF (\u201cTCF Preferred Stock\u201d) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive a share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Huntington in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto (all shares of such newly created series, collectively, the \u201cNew Huntington Preferred Stock\u201d) and, upon such conversion, the TCF Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time. \n\n\n1.7  Huntington Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Huntington Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. \n\n\n1.8  Treatment of TCF Equity Awards. \n\n\n(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by TCF to purchase shares of TCF Common Stock under a TCF Stock Plan (as defined below) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cTCF Stock Option\u201d) shall be assumed and converted automatically into an option (an \u201cAdjusted Stock Option\u201d) to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such TCF Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms), the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Huntington Common Stock) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share of Huntington Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Exchange Ratio. \n\n\n(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of TCF Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a TCF Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cTCF Restricted Stock Award\u201d) shall (i) if \n\n\n-3-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ngranted to a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of TCF, fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (without interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date and in no event later than ten (10) business days following the Closing Date (or on such later date if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code) and (ii) if not granted to an individual described in clause (i) hereof, be assumed and converted into a restricted stock award of shares of Huntington Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such TCF Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms), and relating to the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Huntington Common Stock. \n\n\n(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of TCF Common Stock granted under a TCF Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cTCF Restricted Stock Unit Award\u201d) shall be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit award (with any performance goals deemed satisfied at the greater of the target and actual level of performance through the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the Closing as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of TCF in the ordinary course consistent with past practice) in respect of Huntington Common Stock (an \u201cAdjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award\u201d) with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such TCF Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms) and relating to the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Huntington Common Stock; provided that each such Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to service-based vesting only and shall no longer be subject to any performance conditions. \n\n\n(d) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a deferred share of TCF Common Stock granted under a TCF Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cTCF Deferred Stock Award\u201d) shall be assumed and converted automatically into a deferred stock award of shares of Huntington Common Stock subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such TCF Deferred Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, and relating to the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Deferred Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Huntington Common Stock. \n\n\n(e) Each holder of a TCF Restricted Stock Award converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration that would have otherwise been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Huntington Common Stock (after aggregating all shares to be delivered in respect of all TCF Equity Awards held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment (rounded to the nearest cent) (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional \n\n\n-4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\npart of a share of Huntington Common Stock (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) multiplied by the Huntington Share Closing Price (as defined below). \n\n\n(f) Promptly following the Effective Time, Huntington shall file a post-effective amendment to the S-4 or an effective registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Huntington Common Stock subject to the applicable adjusted TCF Equity Awards, as required. \n\n\n(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, TCF, the Board of Directors of TCF and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary for the treatment of the TCF Equity Awards and to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.8. \n\n\n(h) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: \n\n\n(i) \u201cTCF Equity Awards\u201d means the TCF Stock Options, TCF Restricted Stock Awards, TCF Restricted Stock Unit Awards and TCF Deferred Stock Awards. \n\n\n(ii) \u201cTCF Stock Plans\u201d means the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019, the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2017, the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2015, the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2012, the Amended and Restated Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2006, the Amended and Restated TCF 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Talmer Bancorp Equity Incentive Plan of 2015, the TCF 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, the TCF Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and the TCF Omnibus Employees Deferred Compensation Plan. \n\n\n1.9  Charter of Surviving Corporation.

The Huntington National Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of TCF National Bank shall cease. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, The Huntington National Bank and TCF National Bank \n\n\n-5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nshall enter into an agreement and plan of merger in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the \u201cBank Merger Agreement\u201d). Each of Huntington and TCF shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole shareholder of The Huntington National Bank and TCF National Bank, respectively. Prior to the Effective Time, TCF shall cause TCF National Bank, and Huntington shall cause The Huntington National Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger (\u201cBank Merger Certificates\u201d). \n\n\nARTICLE II \n\n\nEXCHANGE OF SHARES \n\n\n2.1  Huntington to Make Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Huntington shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Huntington and reasonably acceptable to TCF (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates (which for purposes of this Article II shall be deemed to include certificates or book-entry account statements representing shares of TCF Preferred Stock), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates or, at Huntington\u2019s option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of Huntington Common Stock and New Huntington Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and Section 1.6 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of TCF Common Stock and TCF Preferred Stock (collectively, referred to herein as \u201cNew Certificates\u201d), and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such New Certificates and cash described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). 2.2  Exchange of Shares. \n\n\n(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, Huntington shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock, as applicable, pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Huntington Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock, as applicable, which the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Huntington Common Stock to which such holder of TCF Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (B) a \n\n\n-6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ncheck representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of a fractional share which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2 or (ii) (A) a New Certificate representing the number of shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock to which such holder of TCF Preferred Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (B) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, as applicable, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Huntington Common Stock, New Huntington Preferred Stock or any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Huntington Common Stock or shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock which the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. \n\n\n(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Huntington Common Stock or New Huntington Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Huntington Common Stock or shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock which the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after giving effect to Section 6.11). \n\n\n(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock or New Huntington Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock or New Huntington Preferred Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. \n\n\n-7-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of TCF of the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of Huntington Common Stock or New Huntington Preferred Stock, as applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II. \n\n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Huntington Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, no dividend or distribution with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Huntington. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Huntington shall pay to each former holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices of Huntington Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the \u201cNASDAQ\u201d) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) consecutive full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the \u201cHuntington Share Closing Price\u201d) by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of TCF Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Huntington Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Article I. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. \n\n\n(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of TCF Common Stock and TCF Preferred Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of TCF Common Stock and TCF Preferred Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of Huntington Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares or shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock, as applicable, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Huntington Common Stock or New Huntington Preferred Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock, as applicable that such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Huntington, TCF, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. \n\n\n(g) Huntington shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Huntington Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of TCF Common Stock, TCF Preferred Stock or \n\n\n-8-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nTCF Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Huntington or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of TCF Common Stock, TCF Preferred Stock or TCF Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Huntington or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. \n\n\n(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Huntington or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Huntington or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of Huntington Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or the shares of New Huntington Preferred Stock, as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. \n\n\nARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TCF \n\n\nExcept (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by TCF to Huntington concurrently herewith (the \u201cTCF Disclosure Schedule\u201d); provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the TCF Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by TCF that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any TCF Reports publicly filed prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d or disclosures of risks set forth in any \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), TCF hereby represents and warrants to Huntington as follows: 3.1 Corporate Organization.

TCF (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to TCF, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of TCF by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to TCF\u2019s outside auditors and the audit committee of TCF\u2019s Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect TCF\u2019s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of TCF, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in TCF\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to TCF\u2019s auditors and audit committee and true, correct and complete copies of such disclosures have been made available to Huntington. To the knowledge of TCF, there is no reason to believe that TCF\u2019s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. \n\n\n(d) Since January 1, 2018, (i) neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of TCF, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of TCF, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that TCF or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or attorney representing TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed or retained by TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of TCF or any committee thereof or similar governing body of any TCF Subsidiary or any committee thereof, or, to the knowledge of TCF, to any director or officer of TCF or any TCF Subsidiary. \n\n\n-16-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n3.7  Broker\u2019s Fees.

material liability of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a TCF Benefit Plan, or any other party. \n\n\n(j) None of TCF or its Subsidiaries nor any TCF ERISA Affiliate nor, to the knowledge of TCF, any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any \u201cprohibited

Each party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing and with sufficient opportunity to comment, other than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; and provided, that each party shall promptly advise the other party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity which the other party does not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and applicable law. \n\n\n(c)  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Huntington and TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Huntington, TCF and their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Huntington or TCF or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and neither Huntington nor TCF nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be permitted (without the written consent of the other party), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with the foregoing or obtaining any permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a \u201cMaterially Burdensome Regulatory Condition\u201d). \n\n\n(d)  Huntington and TCF shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Huntington, TCF or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Huntington and TCF agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed and becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the time of filing and the date of mailing to the respective shareholders of TCF or Huntington and at the time of the Huntington Meeting and the TCF Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a \n\n\n-52-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nmaterial fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading, and (iii) any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will, at the time each is filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Huntington and TCF further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement. \n\n\n(e)  Huntington and TCF shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. \n\n\n(f)  Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1, TCF shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Huntington and its Subsidiaries (including the furnishing of information and by making employees reasonably available) as is reasonably requested by Huntington in order to comply with the requirements of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing programs. \n\n\n6.2      Access to Information. \n\n\n(a)  Subject to Section 9.7, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws (including the Pandemic Measures), each of Huntington and TCF, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time the conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal business operations, each of Huntington and TCF shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other party\u2019s regular business operations during any such access. Neither Huntington nor TCF nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Huntington\u2019s or TCF\u2019s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the \n\n\n-53-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ndate of this Agreement or to the extent that TCF or Huntington, as the case may be, reasonably determines, in light of the Pandemic or the Pandemic Measures that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any of its employees. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. \n\n\n(b)  Each of Huntington and TCF shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party\u2019s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated November 20, 2020, between Huntington and TCF (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d). \n\n\n(c)  No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 respective operations.      6.3      TCF Shareholder Approval. \n\n\n(a)  TCF shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the TCF Articles and TCF Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the \u201cTCF Meeting\u201d) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite TCF Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Except in the case of a TCF Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of TCF the Requisite TCF Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the \u201cTCF Board Recommendation\u201d) and shall not make a TCF Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with this Section 6.3. TCF shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Huntington to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite TCF Vote. However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of TCF, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger, then, prior to the receipt of the Requisite TCF Vote, in submitting this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of TCF may withhold or withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Huntington the TCF Board Recommendation or may submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders without recommendation (each, a \u201cTCF Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of TCF may communicate the basis for its TCF Adverse Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto; provided, that the Board of Directors of TCF may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Huntington at least three (3) business days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving \n\n\n-54-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nrise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of TCF in response to a TCF Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such TCF Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of TCF takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Huntington and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger. Any material amendment to any TCF Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new TCF Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. \n\n\n(b)  Except in the case of a TCF Adverse Recommendation Change, TCF shall adjourn or postpone the TCF Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of TCF Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, TCF has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite TCF Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the TCF Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of TCF at the TCF Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve TCF of such obligation. TCF shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the TCF Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b). \n\n\n6.4      Huntington Shareholder Approval. \n\n\n(a)  Huntington shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Huntington Articles and Huntington Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the \u201cHuntington Meeting\u201d) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Huntington Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Except in the case of a Huntington Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of Huntington shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Huntington the Requisite Huntington Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve the Merger and the Huntington Charter Amendment (the \u201cHuntington Board Recommendation\u201d) and shall not make a Huntington Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with this Section 6.4. Huntington shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to TCF to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite Huntington Vote. However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Huntington, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger, then, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Huntington Vote, in submitting this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of Huntington may withhold or withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to TCF the Huntington Board \n\n\n-55-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nRecommendation or may submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders without recommendation (each, a \u201cHuntington Adverse Recommendation Change\u201d) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Huntington may communicate the basis for its Huntington Adverse Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto; provided, that the Board of Directors of Huntington may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives TCF at least three (3) business days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Huntington takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by TCF and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger. \n\n\n(b)  Except in the case of a Huntington Adverse Recommendation Change, Huntington shall adjourn or postpone the Huntington Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Huntington Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, Huntington has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Huntington Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Huntington Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of Huntington at the Huntington Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of the Merger and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Huntington of such obligation. Huntington shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Huntington Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.4(b). Each of TCF and Huntington shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the TCF Meeting and the Huntington Meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. \n\n\n6.5      Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of Huntington and TCF shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly as practicable, (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by TCF or Huntington or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \n\n\n-56-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.6      Stock Exchange Listing. Huntington shall cause the shares of Huntington Common Stock and New Huntington Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. \n\n\n6.7      Employee Matters. \n\n\n(a)  Huntington shall provide the employees of TCF and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the \u201cContinuing Employees\u201d), during the periods specified below for so long as they are employed following the Effective Time, with the following: (i) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, annual base salary or wages, as applicable, that are no less than the annual base salary or wages in effect for each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2021, (A) target incentive opportunities (excluding equity-based awards but including any annual or short term cash incentive) that are no less favorable than those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) employee benefits (other than severance) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) during the period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, (A) target incentive opportunities (including equity-based awards) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Huntington and its Subsidiaries, and (B) employee benefits (other than severance) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Huntington and its Subsidiaries (excluding any frozen benefit plans of Huntington and its Subsidiaries or benefit plans that exclusively provide benefits to grandfathered employees of Huntington and its Subsidiaries); provided, that until such time as Huntington fully integrates the Continuing Employees into its plans, participation in the TCF Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standards, it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participating in the plans of Huntington and its Subsidiaries on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to different benefit plans. For a period beginning at the Effective Time and continuing through the first anniversary thereof, each Continuing Employee who is not party to an individual agreement providing for severance or termination benefits and is terminated under severance qualifying circumstances shall be eligible to receive severance benefits as set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule, subject to such employee\u2019s execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claims. \n\n\n(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plans of Huntington or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the \u201cNew Plans\u201d), Huntington and its Subsidiaries shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous TCF Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a TCF Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits (including medical, dental and vision), to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous TCF Benefit \n\n\n-57-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nPlan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize all service of such employees with TCF and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous TCF Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits, or (D) for purposes of any equity incentive awards granted by Huntington. \n\n\n(c)  Effective as of the Effective Time, Huntington agrees to assume and honor all TCF Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof, it being understood that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend or terminate any TCF Benefit Plan to the extent that such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan. Huntington and TCF shall take the actions necessary to implement the commitments set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the Huntington Disclosure Schedule. \n\n\n(d)  If requested by Huntington in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior to the Effective Time, TCF shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by TCF (the \u201cTCF 401(k) Plan\u201d) to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Huntington requests that any TCF 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Huntington or one of its Subsidiaries (a \u201cHuntington 401(k) Plan\u201d). TCF and Huntington shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the TCF 401(k) Plan and/or Huntington 401(k) Plan to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the Huntington 401(k) Plan of \u201celigible rollover distributions\u201d (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof. TCF shall provide Huntington with evidence that the TCF 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 6.7(d); provided, that prior to amending or terminating the TCF 401(k) Plan, TCF shall provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to Huntington for review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). \n\n\n(e)  On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting) to be provided or communicated by TCF with respect to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of Huntington, and TCF shall consider in good faith revising such notice or communication to reflect any comments or advice that Huntington timely provides. \n\n\n(f)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, TCF, Huntington, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, TCF, Huntington or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, \n\n\n-58-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nofficer, director or consultant of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any TCF Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular TCF Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. \n\n\n6.8      Indemnification; Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance. \n\n\n(a)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of TCF and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the \u201cTCF Indemnified Parties\u201d) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by the TCF Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses the TCF Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such TCF Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. \n\n\n(b)  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by TCF (provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by TCF for such insurance (the \u201cPremium Cap\u201d), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, TCF, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Huntington, may (and at the request of Huntington, TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a \n\n\n-59-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nsix-year \u201ctail\u201d policy under TCF\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. If TCF purchases such a tail policy, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. \n\n\n(c)  The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each TCF Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. \n\n\n(d)  The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Huntington and TCF under this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any TCF Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the affected person. \n\n\n6.9      Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Huntington or the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the then current officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the expense of the party who makes any such request. \n\n\n6.10 Advice of Changes. Huntington and TCF shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development known to it (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. \n\n\n-60-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Huntington and TCF shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Huntington Common Stock and TCF Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of TCF Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of TCF Common Stock and any shares of Huntington Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. \n\n\n6.12 Corporate Governance; Foundation. \n\n\n(a)  Huntington shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective Time, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of Huntington shall be increased by five (5) for a total of eighteen (18) directors, and five (5) current directors of TCF shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of Huntington (the \u201cTCF Directors\u201d). Each of the TCF Directors shall be designated by TCF, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of Huntington (not to be unreasonably withheld). One TCF Director shall not stand for re-election to the Huntington Board of Directors at Huntington\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. In addition, as of the effective time of the Bank Merger, Gary Torgow shall be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of The Huntington National Bank. Following the Effective Time, the meetings of the Board of Directors of Huntington and, following the effective time of the Bank Merger, the Board of Directors of The Huntington National Bank shall rotate between (i) Columbus and (ii) Detroit / Minneapolis. \n\n\n(b)  The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall have dual headquarters for banking operations in Columbus, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, with the headquarters of the consumer banking operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries being located in Columbus, Ohio and the headquarters of the commercial banking operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries being located in Detroit, Michigan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the headquarters of the Surviving Corporation and the main office of The Huntington National Bank shall be located in Columbus, Ohio. Huntington and TCF (A) agree that it is the intention of the Surviving Corporation to increase total employment in the planned TCF headquarters building located at the corner of Woodward and Elizabeth Streets in Detroit, Michigan to at least eight hundred (800) employees and (B) recognize the continued importance of Minneapolis, Midland and Chicago to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. \n\n\n(c)  At or prior to the Closing, Huntington shall contribute $50 million to establish a new Huntington Donor Advised Fund at the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan (the \u201cFoundation\u201d), dedicated to supporting primarily any markets in which Huntington operates. TCF\u2019s current Executive Chairman and TCF\u2019s current Chief Executive Officer shall recommend and allocate such funds in a manner generally consistent with Huntington\u2019s recommended charitable giving guidelines as set forth on Section 6.12(c) of the Huntington Disclosure Schedule, and shall periodically report to Huntington regarding the activities, contributions and grants made by the Foundation. TCF\u2019s current Executive Chairman and TCF\u2019s current Chief Executive Officer may fully distribute the Foundation\u2019s funds over a seven (7) year period from the Closing Date (and shall not fully distribute such funds prior to the end of such period). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing rights of TCF\u2019s current Executive Chairman and TCF\u2019s current Chief \n\n\n-61-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nExecutive Officer with respect to the Foundation shall be personal to such individuals and shall not vest or create any rights in any of their successors, heirs or representatives. \n\n\n6.13  Acquisition Proposals. \n\n\n(a)  TCF shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any TCF Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of TCF, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, a TCF Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.13(a); provided, that, prior to the receipt of the Requisite TCF Vote, in the event TCF receives an unsolicited bona fide written TCF Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to or concurrently with providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, TCF shall have provided such information to Huntington, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with TCF. TCF will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Huntington with respect to any TCF Acquisition Proposal. TCF will promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) advise Huntington following receipt of any TCF Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a TCF Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or TCF Acquisition Proposal) and will keep Huntington reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or TCF Acquisition Proposal. TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of TCF, to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. During the term of this Agreement, TCF shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.13(a)) relating to any TCF Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, \u201cTCF Acquisition Proposal\u201d shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, inquiry or proposal relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of TCF and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of TCF or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% \n\n\n-62-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nor more of the consolidated assets of TCF, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of TCF or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of TCF, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination, reorganization or similar transaction involving TCF or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of TCF. \n\n\n(b)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a TCF Acquisition Proposal or Huntington Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to such party\u2019s shareholders; provided, that such Rules and disclosures will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules or any such disclosures would otherwise have under this Agreement. \n\n\n6.14 Public Announcements. TCF and Huntington shall each use their reasonable best efforts  to develop a joint communications plan,  to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and  except in respect of (i) any announcement required by applicable law or regulation, or a request by a Governmental Entity, (ii) communications that are substantially similar to communications previously approved pursuant to this Section 6.14, (iii) communications permitted by Section 6.3 or Section 6.4 or (iv) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, TCF and Huntington agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. \n\n\n6.15 Change of Method. Huntington may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger if and to the extent requested by Huntington, and TCF agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Huntington may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to TCF\u2019s shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed. \n\n\n6.16 Restructuring Efforts. If either TCF or Huntington shall have failed to obtain the Requisite TCF Vote or the Requisite Huntington Vote at the duly convened TCF Meeting or Huntington Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided, however, that no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.16) to its shareholders for approval. \n\n\n-63-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.17 Takeover Restrictions. Neither TCF nor Huntington shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Restriction to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Huntington and TCF shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Restriction now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Restriction may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Huntington and TCF will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Restriction on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Restriction. \n\n\n6.18 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). TCF and Huntington agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of TCF subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the \u201cTCF Insiders\u201d), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that TCF Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of TCF Common Stock, TCF Preferred Stock and TCF Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.18. The Boards of Directors of Huntington and of TCF, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (x) in the case of TCF, any dispositions of TCF Common Stock, TCF Preferred Stock or TCF Equity Awards by TCF Insiders and (y) in the case of Huntington, any acquisitions of Huntington Common Stock, New Huntington Preferred Stock or equity awards of Huntington into which the TCF Equity awards are converted by any TCF Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of Huntington subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. \n\n\n6.19 Litigation and Claims. Each of Huntington and TCF shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law and regulation, promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Huntington or TCF, as applicable, threatened against Huntington, TCF or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Huntington, TCF, or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. TCF shall give Huntington the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against TCF and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Huntington\u2019s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). \n\n\n-64-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.20 Assumption of TCF Debt. Effective at the Effective Time (or at the effective time of the Bank Merger for any debt of TCF National Bank), Huntington or The Huntington National Bank, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted thereunder and required thereby, assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by TCF or TCF National Bank pursuant to the definitive documents governing the short-term and long-term borrowings set forth on Section 6.20 of the TCF Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the principal of such borrowings (and premium, if any) and interest thereon. In connection therewith, (i) Huntington and TCF shall, and shall cause The Huntington National Bank and TCF National Bank respectively to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, if applicable, and (ii) TCF shall, and shall cause TCF National Bank to, use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any officer\u2019s certificates or other documents, and to provide any opinions of counsel to the trustee thereof, in each case, required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time or the effective time of the Bank Merger, as applicable. \n\n\nARTICLE VII \n\n\nCONDITIONS PRECEDENT \n\n\n7.1      Conditions to Each Party\u2019s Obligation to Effect the Merger.

In no event shall TCF or Huntington be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. (e) Each of Huntington and TCF acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if TCF or Huntington, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the \u201cprime rate\u201d (as announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by TCF and Huntington pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c), respectively, and this Section 8.2(e), constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the other party in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such applicable section. \n\n\n-71-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nARTICLE IX \n\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS \n\n\n9.1      Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.

To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series [H] Preferred Stock, any Parity Stock, any Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation. \n\n\n(c) Priority of Dividends. So long as any share of Series [H] Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the Series [H] Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or \n\n\n To reflect the last dividend payment date in respect of the 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, no par value, of TCF Financial Corporation. \n\n\n1 \n\n\n1 \n\n\nC-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nexchange for Junior Stock, during such dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then\u2011current Dividend Period per share on Series [H] Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulation, on any Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series [H] Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. \n\n\nSection 5.    Liquidation Rights. \n\n\n(a) Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of any holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series [H] Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation\u2019s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. Holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. \n\n\n(b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. \n\n\n(c) Residual Distributions. If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Corporation. \n\n\n(d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the \n\n\nC-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\naffairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. \n\n\nSection 6.    Redemption. \n\n\n(a) Optional Redemption. The Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on [\u00b7]  or any Dividend Payment Date thereafter, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. The redemption price for shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall be $25,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods, without accumulation of undeclared dividends (the \u201cRedemption Price\u201d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation may, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, provide notice of its intent to redeem as provided in Section 6(b) below, and subsequently redeem, all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at the Redemption Price applicable on such date of redemption. \n\n\n(b) Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall be either (i) mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Corporation or (ii) transmitted by such other method approved by the Depositary Trust Company, in its reasonable discretion, to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing or transmittal shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series [H] Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice mailed or transmitted as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail or other transmission, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing or transmittal thereof, to any holder of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. \n\n\n(c) Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of Series [H] Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock held by such holders or \n\n\n To be no earlier than December 1, 2022. \n\n\n2 \n\n\n2 \n\n\nC-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nin such other manner consistent with the rules and policies of the NASDAQ as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. \n\n\n(d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (the \u201cDepositary Company\u201d) in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. \n\n\nSection 7.    Voting Rights . The holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors, except as expressly provided by law and except that: \n\n\n(a) Supermajority Voting Rights-Amendments. Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66\u2154% of all of the shares of the Series [H] Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the Charter or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto (including any articles supplementary or any similar document relating to any series of preferred stock) which will materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series [H] Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that the following will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series [H] Preferred Stock: (i) any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series [H] Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the amount of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation, or (iii) the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series [H] Preferred Stock with respect to the payment \n\n\nC-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nof dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. \n\n\n(b) Supermajority Voting Rights-Priority . Unless the vote or consent of the holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66\u2154% of all of the shares of the Series [H] Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any additional class or series of stock ranking prior to the shares of the Series [H] Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. \n\n\n(c) Special Voting Right. \n\n\n(i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Series [H] Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series [H] Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series [H] Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation\u2019s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series [H] Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a \u201cPreferred Director.\u201d \n\n\n(ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation\u2019s stock that ranks on parity with Series [H] Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i) above, a majority of the Continuing Directors may, and within 20 days after the written request of any holder of Series [H] Preferred Stock (addressed to the Continuing Directors at the Corporation\u2019s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock, and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series [H] Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by \n\n\nC-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nthem as provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. \n\n\n(iii) Notice for Special Meeting. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation\u2019s bylaws for a special meeting of the stockholders. The Preferred Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation\u2019s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation\u2019s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders. \n\n\n(iv) Termination; Removal. Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series [H] Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series [H] Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (subject to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) and the term of office of each Preferred Director so elected will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Corporation\u2019s board of directors will be automatically reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Corporation\u2019s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c). \n\n\n(d) Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall be required pursuant to Section 7(a), (b) or (c) above if, at or prior to the time when any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such section, all outstanding Series [H] Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed, or notice of redemption has been given and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust to effect such redemption. \n\n\nSection 8.    Conversion. The holders of Series [H] Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series [H] Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation. \n\n\nSection 9.    Rank. Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Charter or these Articles Supplementary to the contrary, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, without the vote of the holders of the Series [H] Preferred Stock, may \n\n\nC-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nauthorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7, any class of securities ranking senior to the Series [H] Preferred Stock as to dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. \n\n\nSection 10.    Repurchase. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series [H] Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may determine; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent. \n\n\nSection 11.    Unissued or Reacquired Shares. Shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series. \n\n\nSection 12.    No Sinking Fund. Shares of Series [H] Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund. \n\n\nSECOND: The Series [H] Preferred Stock has been classified and designated by the Board of Directors and the Committee, under the authority contained in the Charter. THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board of Directors and the Committee in the manner and by the vote required by law. FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall become effective on [\u25cf]. FIFTH: The undersigned Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation acknowledges these Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of the Corporation and, as to all matters or facts required to be verified under oath, the undersigned Officer acknowledges that, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, these matters and facts are true in all material respects and that this statement is made under the penalties of perjury. \n\n\nC-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and attested to by its [duly authorized officer] on this [\u25cf]day of [\u25cf], [\u25cf]. \n\n\nATTEST: HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED \n\n\nBy: By: Name: Name: Stephen D.

It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and applicable state and local tax purposes), the Merger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code. \n\n\nARTICLE II TREATMENT OF SECURITIES \n\n\nSection 2.1          Treatment of Securities. \n\n\n(a)          Treatment of Company Common Shares.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.03 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Common Shares\u201d) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company Restricted Share Awards but excluding (x) Company Common Shares owned directly by the Company or Parent (such excluded shares, the \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d) and (y) Dissenting Shares (all such outstanding shares, including Company Restricted Share Awards but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, the \u201cEligible Shares\u201d), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration on a per share basis, without interest: (i) $2.89 in cash (the \u201cCash Consideration\u201d) and (ii) 1.408 shares (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d) of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) (including such cash in lieu of fractional shares, the \u201cStock Consideration\u201d and together with the Cash Consideration, the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). -2-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          Effect of Conversion on Company Common Shares.  In addition to the effects described in Section 2.1(a) above, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, as of the Effective Time, all of the Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in book-entry form previously evidencing any of the Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \u201cCompany Book-Entry Shares\u201d) and each certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \u201cCompany Certificates\u201d) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the right, if any, to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d). \n\n\n(c)          Cancellation of Excluded Shares.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. \n\n\n(d)          Treatment of Dissenting Shares.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who has complied with the applicable provisions of Subchapter H, Chapter 10 of the TBOC prior to the Effective Time (\u201cDissenting Shareholder Statute\u201d and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under the Dissenting Shareholder Statute, then the right of such holder to any such payments shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration.  The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any written demands, notices or instruments received by the Company pursuant to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute and/or relating to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute or any alleged dissenter\u2019s or similar rights, and any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parent\u2019s expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, provided that Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. -3-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)          Parent Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger. \n\n\nSection 2.2          Exchange of Certificates. \n\n\n(a)          Exchange Agent.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (it being agreed and understood that Equiniti Trust Company is reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the exchange agent) (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash comprising the aggregate Cash Consideration and approximately the amount required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case for the sole benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares.  In addition, in the event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the cash in lieu of any fractional shares payment pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c), out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.  Such Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the \u201cExchange Fund.\u201d  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement. \n\n\n(b)          Exchange Procedures. \n\n\n(i)          Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or the Company Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.7) or transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to the Company Book-Entry Shares) (the \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d), and (B) instructions for surrendering the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.7) or transferring the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or other distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  With respect to holders of the Company Book-Entry Shares, the Parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to promptly transmit, following the Effective Time, to such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Eligible Shares, the Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or other distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(ii)          Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are represented by the Company Certificates, by physical surrender of such Company Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate, as provided in Section 2.7) or that are Company Book-Entry Shares, by book-receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Exchange Agent in connection with the transfer of Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent and the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (B) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)) of (1) the Cash Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a), plus (2) any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) plus (3) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d). \n\n\n(iii)          No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company Common Shares that have been so surrendered shall be canceled by the Exchange Agent. \n\n\n(iv)          In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)) or cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Company Certificate and any dividends or other distributions in respect thereof, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Company Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent.  Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Company Book- Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Company Certificate and Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, including any amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d), in each case without interest. -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement.  No dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Company Certificate as provided in Section 2.7) or the Company Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II.  Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this Article II, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. \n\n\n(d)          Transfers.  From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.  If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. \n\n\n(e)          No Fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.  Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 2.2(e) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any such fractional share, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the VWAP of Parent Common Shares.  No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in this Section 2.2(e) to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.  The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)          Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporation\u2019s demand, and any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for delivery of any Merger Consideration and any payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2(c), Section 2.2(e) and Section 5.11(d), in each case, without any interest thereon. \n\n\n(g)          No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. \n\n\n(h)          Withholding.

If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to either of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either Party, and such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. -61-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the \u201cCompany Shareholders Meeting\u201d) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required Vote and if so desired and mutually agreed by the Parties, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.  Unless a Change in Recommendation has occurred in accordance with Section 5.4, the Company and the Board of Trust Managers of the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company the Company Required Vote.  Unless a Change in Recommendation has occurred in accordance with Section 5.4, the Company and its Board of Trust Managers will recommend to its shareholders approval of the Merger and the Company shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include such recommendation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(b), if, on the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to (and at the request of Parent shall) make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting; provided that the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).  Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.  The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or its Board of Trust Managers of any Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Recommendation or by any development, fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a right to make a Change in Recommendation. -62-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its common stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the \u201cParent Stockholders Meeting\u201d) for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Required Vote and if so desired and mutually agreed by the Parties, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.  Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the common stockholders of Parent the Parent Required Vote.  Parent and its Board of Directors will recommend to its common stockholders approval of the Merger and Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include such recommendation (the \u201cParent Recommendation Actions\u201d).  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(c), if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to (and at the request of the Company shall) make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholders Meeting; provided that the Parent Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).  Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the Merger to its common stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.  Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and to take the Parent Recommendation Actions pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent or its Board of Directors of any Acquisition Proposal. \n\n\n(d)          Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Shareholders Meeting to be held on the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. \n\n\nSection 5.2          Access to Information.  Upon reasonable notice, and at the reasonable request of the other Party, each of the Company and Parent, solely for purposes of furthering the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or integration planning relating thereto, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties (provided that no invasive testing may be conducted), books, contracts, records, personnel and Representatives; provided that all such access shall be coordinated through the other Party or its Representatives in accordance with such procedures as they may reasonably establish.  Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.  The Parties will cooperate in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  No such investigation by any Party shall affect the representations and warranties of any other Party.  The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information and access provided pursuant to this Section 5.2. \n\n\nSection 5.3          Efforts; Notice of Certain Events. -63-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(a)          Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to being exchanged with the other Party, any materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney- client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. -64-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Laws, including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed). \n\n\n(d)          Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take such actions as the other may reasonably request to obtain any consents from any third parties (excluding any Governmental Entity) as may be reasonably required to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

Such notice shall be made orally and promptly confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence, including proposed agreements).

\n\n\n(b)          by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling in each case permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, and such order, decree or ruling has become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in such order, decree or ruling; \n\n\n(c)          by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York time, on January 15, 2022 (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated before such date; \n\n\n(d)          by Parent, at any time before (but not after) the time of the Company Required Vote if (i) a Change in Recommendation shall have been made or occurred or (ii) the Company or any trust manager of the Company shall have committed a Willful Breach of Section 5.4(a), other than in the case where such Willful Breach is the result of an isolated action by a trust manager of the Company without knowledge of or consent by the Company prior to such action, and is not any other action by the Company, and (A) the Company takes appropriate actions to remedy such Willful Breach upon discovery thereof, and (B) Parent or the Merger are not adversely affected in any material respect as a result thereof; \n\n\n(e)          by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true (i) would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) to be satisfied and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) 30 days after the giving of written notice by the Company to Parent of such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true; provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b); -81-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)          by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (other than with respect to a material breach of Section 5.4, as to which Section 7.1(d) will apply), or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true (i) would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) to be satisfied and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) 30 days after the giving of written notice by Parent to the Company of such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true;

or \n\n\n(i)          by the Company, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Vote is obtained, but not after, the Board of Trust Managers of the Company authorizes the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4(b)(iv). \n\n\nSection 7.2          Effect of Termination. \n\n\n(a)          In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company or Parent or their respective trust managers or directors or Representatives or Affiliates, except as provided under Section 7.2(b), Section 7.2(e) and Section 7.2(f) and except with respect to Section 5.8, Section 5.12, the expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent in Section 5.14, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII and except for the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive such termination; provided that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement. \n\n\n(b)          Company Termination Fee. \n\n\n(i)          If (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent the Company Termination Fee within two Business Days after the date of such termination. -82-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(ii)          In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (A) either by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(g) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(f) and, in any case, prior to the date of termination the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal or a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and (B) within 12 months of the date of any termination referred to in clause (A) the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(ii), the references to \u201c15%\u201d in the definition of \u201cAcquisition Proposal\u201d will be deemed to be references to \u201c50%\u201d), then the Company shall, within two Business Days of the earlier of the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or any such Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent the Company Termination Fee. \n\n\n(c)          In no event shall this Section 7.2 require the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. \n\n\n(d)          If Parent decides to apply for a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the receipt of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance (if any) requested by Parent with respect thereto. \n\n\n(e)          The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and neither Party shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of the Company Termination Fee, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company Termination Fee shall become due and payable in connection with this Section 7.2, from and after such termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.2 and except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach, the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the termination of this Agreement, other than as provided in this Section 7.2.  Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.  Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent under this Section 7.2 on the dates specified, then the Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in The Wall Street Journal, from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent. -83-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)          The \u201cCompany Termination Fee\u201d shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $115,000,000 (the \u201cCompany Base Amount\u201d) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the \u201cREIT Requirements\u201d) for such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined in good faith by independent accountants to Parent (taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate \u201ccushion\u201d as determined by such accountants).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent\u2019s receipt of the Company Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days.  In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Company Base Amount due to the above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent\u2019s receipt of the unpaid Company\u2019s Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, in which event the Company shall pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof.  The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement.  Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company.  \u201cQualifying Income\u201d shall mean income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)\u2013(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)\u2013(I) of the Code.  \u201cTax Guidance\u201d shall mean a reasoned opinion from counsel or other tax advisor or a ruling from the IRS. \n\n\nARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS \n\n\nSection 8.1          Survival.  None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time. \n\n\nSection 8.2          Amendment; Waiver.  Subject to the provisions of applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived if, and only if, such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment or modification, by the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. The conditions to each of the respective Parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are for the sole benefit of such Party and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law.  No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. -84-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 8.3          Notices.

(c)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Common Stock, the \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 3.7. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment (unless required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   Section 2.8           Treatment of Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock.   (a)           Each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to (a) (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (b) the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalent rights under such Company RSU, net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.7. Following the Effective Time, no such Company RSU that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any such Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.8(a) in exchange for such Company RSU in accordance with this Section 2.8(a). The consideration payable under this Section 2.8(a) to each former holder of a Company RSU that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation\u2019s payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter).

By virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to effectuate the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock contemplated by this Section 2.8(b).   Section 2.9            No Right to Equity under Awards   . The parties agree that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company RSU or any other equity-based awards shall have any right to acquire any Equity Interest (including any \u201cphantom\u201d stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.10          Adjustments to Prevent Dilution   . In the event that the Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.10 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.   ARTICLE III EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 3.1            Paying Agent. Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company as Parent shall determine and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with Section 2.7, immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2.

The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any amounts payable in respect of Company RSUs shall not be deposited with the Paying Agent but shall instead be paid through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates in accordance with Section 2.8(a). Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company Common Stock that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.   \n\n\n26   \n\n\n  Section 3.2            Exchange Procedures.   (a)          As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall send to each record holder of a Certificate or holder of Book- entry Shares (other than Excluded Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), (x) upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in Section 3.6) to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent; (y) upon the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock that are Book-entry Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and accompanying instructions (including such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent); or (z) upon the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock that are Book-entry Shares held through DTC, including by delivery of an \u201cagent\u2019s message,\u201d in accordance with DTC\u2019s procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Paying Agent and DTC, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and Book-entry Shares upon compliance by the respective holders thereof with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.   (b)           No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i). Any Certificate that has been surrendered shall be cancelled by the Paying Agent.   (c)           In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check in the proper amount of cash pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee only if (i) in the case of Book-entry Shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of Book-entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, and (ii) in the case of Certificates, the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case, together with all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.   Section 3.3            No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article II and this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.   Section 3.4            Termination of Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for nine months after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates or Book-entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2, without interest. If, immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book- entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in Section 3.2 to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   \n\n\n27   \n\n\n  Section 3.5            Investment of Exchange Fund.

No losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-entry Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.   Section 3.6             Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.   Section 3.7            Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company RSU such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   Section 3.8             Further Assurances.

From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.

(c)          In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.3(b), the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, and prior to engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing information to, a Person (or such Person\u2019s representatives) who has made an Acquisition Proposal, (i) notify Parent of the receipt by the Company or the Representatives of the Company of such Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include (A) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (B) the identity of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) contemporaneously with or prior to furnishing any information to such Person (or such Person\u2019s representatives), furnish such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the information described in Section 6.3(b) or this Section 6.3(c) to Parent.   \n\n\n65   \n\n\n  (d)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, other than in connection with or as a result of breaching or violating this Section 6.3 (other than an isolated, inadvertent and immaterial breach or violation), that the Company Board concludes in good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time when the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event after such Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), if it determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to take such actions contemplated by clauses (x) or (y) below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation as a result of such Superior Proposal or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and simultaneously enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section 8.1(d)(i) and Section 8.2; and, provided further, that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:   (i)            the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation or termination (the \u201cSuperior Proposal Notice Period\u201d), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and the identity of the Person or Group making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution draft of the relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal (the \u201cAlternative Acquisition Agreement \u201d) and other material documents with respect to such Superior Proposal (including any with respect to the financing thereof); and   (ii)           prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal, (A) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated (to the extent Parent wishes to so negotiate), and shall have caused the Representatives of the Company to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) following the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered any such amendments in good faith, and After Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding the terms of any such proposed amendments, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.   \n\n\n66   \n\n\n  In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 6.3(d)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(d) with respect to such new written notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except that the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be at least two Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by Section 6.3(d)(i) above).    (e)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (and in no event after such Company Stockholder Approval is obtained) if the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect such a Change of Board Recommendation unless:   (i)            the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation (the \u201cIntervening Event Notice Period\u201d), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and   (ii)           prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (A) during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated (to the extent Parent wishes to so negotiate), and shall have caused the Representatives of the Company to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make any amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary, and (B) following the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered any such amendments in good faith and, After Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding the terms of any such binding written offer, it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law to not effect the Change of Board Recommendation.   In the event of any changes to the circumstances applicable to the Intervening Event after the start of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 6.3(e)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(e) with respect to such new written notice (including a new Intervening Event Notice Period) except that the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be two Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by Section 6.3(e)(i) above).

(h)         The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Subsidiary or Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company.

(a)          With respect to any \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the \u201cCompany Employees\u201d) will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time (collectively, \u201cNew Plans\u201d), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary to the extent recognized under each Company Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement that is reflected in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable, and not for purposes of any defined benefit or retiree medical plan) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits.

The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, jointly and severally, advance to the Company Indemnified Parties expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, the governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or Company Indemnification Agreements, in each case in existence on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the director or officer to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable organizational document or Company Indemnification Agreement. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Party\u2019s conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, the governing or organizational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ndocuments of any Company Subsidiary or Company Indemnification Agreements, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and reasonably acceptable to the Company Indemnified Party (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

(b)         For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability and fiduciary liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as such policies maintained by the Company as of the date hereof with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to expend an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the \u201cPremium Cap\u201d), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap or such coverage is not otherwise available, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parent\u2019s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, Parent or the Company may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year \u201ctail\u201d policy under the Company\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 and fiduciary liability insurance policies providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.   \n\n\n75   \n\n\n  (c)            The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other Person, then in each such case, Parent will cause, to the extent necessary, proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

Section 6.11        Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of Company Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

The Company may, or if so requested by Parent shall, adjourn the Special Meeting in order to provide for the expiration of the Superior Proposal Notice Period or Intervening Event Notice Period, as applicable. The adoption of this Agreement and adjournment of the Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting, unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent or required by Law.

Section 6.15          Investment Advisory Agreement Consents.   (a )           Clients other than Funds. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the consent of each Client (other than a Fund) for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required by applicable Law or by such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement as a result of the Transactions. In furtherance thereof, except in the case of an Affirmative Consent Client, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in no event less than 60 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, send a written notice (the \u201cNegative Consent Notice\u201d), in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to such Clients informing each Client: (i) of the Transactions; (ii) of the intention to complete the Transactions, which will result in an assignment or deemed assignment of such Investment Advisory Agreement; (iii) of the intention of the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary to continue to provide the advisory services pursuant to the existing Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after the Closing if such Client does not terminate such agreement prior to the Closing; and (iv) that the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client does not terminate its Investment Advisory Agreement, within 60 calendar days after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice (or such longer period as may be required under the Investment Advisory Agreement). If the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement or applicable Law requires the written consent of the Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or if the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary determines, in its discretion, that for commercial reasons it would be prudent or appropriate to obtain the written consent of a Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, then the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, send a written notice, in accordance with applicable Law, and the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, informing such Client (an \u201cAffirmative Consent Client\u201d) of the Transactions and requesting written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, and any such Client shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Client unless and until such Client has provided its written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement.   \n\n\n78  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (b )            Private Funds. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain with respect to each Private Fund, in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable Fund Documents, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (x) the consent of such Private Fund (or some percentage of the Private Fund\u2019s board of directors, advisory committee, investment committee or investors therein, as applicable) for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Private Fund\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required by applicable Law or by such Private Fund\u2019s Fund Documents as a result of the Transactions and (y) any Additional Private Fund Consent applicable to such Private Fund in furtherance thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement.

(ii)            As promptly as practicable following Public Fund Board Approval as described in Section 6.15(c)(i), the Company (or one of the Company Subsidiaries) and Parent shall (in coordination with the applicable Public Fund and under the general direction of the applicable Public Fund Board) jointly cooperate to (A) prepare and file all proxy materials necessary to comply in all material respects with applicable Law for the Public Fund shareholder meeting to approve the Public Fund Shareholder Approval Items as contemplated by Section 6.15(c)(i), (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly clear all SEC comments and (C) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Public Fund Board (it being understood for all purposes of this Agreement that the Company does not control any Public Fund Board) submits, as promptly as practicable following the mailing of the proxy materials, to the shareholders of such Public Fund for a vote at a shareholders meeting the proposal to approve the Public Fund Shareholder Approval Items. Each of the Company and Parent shall have an opportunity to review all drafts of the proxy materials (and any SEC comments thereto) on a timely basis and the right to review in advance of submission to the SEC the proxy materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto) to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund and to (I) approve information or data that is provided by or on behalf of such party or its Affiliates specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials, and (II) provide reasonable comments on such proxy materials, which the other party (in coordination with the applicable Public Fund and under the general direction of the applicable Public Fund Board) will consider in good faith for inclusion therein.   \n\n\n79   \n\n\n  (iii)            As soon as possible following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Public Fund then engaged in a public offering of its shares to (A) file supplements or amendments to its prospectus forming a part of its registration statement then currently in use, which supplements or amendments shall disclose the Transactions to the extent required by applicable Law, and (B) make any other filing necessary under any applicable Law to satisfy in all material respects disclosure requirements in connection with the public distribution of the shares of that Public Fund. Parent shall have the right to provide reasonable comments on such materials to the same extent as provided in Section 6.15(c)(ii).   (iv)            The Company agrees that the information in the proxy materials to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund (other than information that is or will be provided by or on behalf of Parent or any other third party specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials) will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that in the case of a Public Fund that is not sponsored by the Company or Company Subsidiaries (a Sub-Advised Fund), the foregoing agreement of the Company shall apply only to information provided by it or the Company Subsidiaries in writing specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials. Parent agrees that the information provided by it (or on its behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy materials to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (v)             In addition to the agreements described in this Section 6.15(c) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, concurrently with seeking the Public Fund Board Approvals, the Company shall seek an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval with respect to each Public Fund, including each Sub-Advised Fund. The Company and Parent shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval in respect of each Public Fund, including each Sub-Advised Fund. In no event shall seeking or obtaining an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval in respect of a Public Fund relieve the parties of their obligations under Sections 6.15(c)(i)-(iv) with respect to such Public Fund.   (vi)            The Company shall, and shall cause its Investment Adviser Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Investment Advisory Agreement of each Public Fund as of Closing (or as agreed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to be in effect upon or after the Closing) to be on terms and conditions substantially similar (including as to the Applicable Fees) as the terms and conditions under such Investment Advisory Agreement in effect as of the date hereof, unless such Public Fund\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement as of Closing is consistent with the investment advisory agreement proposed by an investment advisor Subsidiary of Parent for Public Fund Board Approval and Public Fund Shareholder Approval.   (vii)           The foregoing notwithstanding (A) an Interim Public Fund IAA Approval shall not constitute Public Fund Board Approval or a Sub-Advised Fund Board Approval in respect of a Public Fund and (B) the parties agree that a Public Fund shall be deemed a Consenting Client for all purposes under this Agreement only if the requisite Public Fund Board Approval, the Sub-Advised Fund Board Approval, the Public Fund Shareholder Approval and the Sub-Advised Fund Shareholder Approval, as applicable, has been obtained and is in full force and effect at the Closing for the Public Fund IAA Approval.   \n\n\n80   \n\n\n  (d)            Parent and the Company agree that any new Client that is not a Fund that enters into an Investment Advisory Agreement with an Investment Adviser Subsidiary between the date of this Agreement and the Closing shall be deemed a Consenting Client for all purposes under this Agreement if (i) the consent (or, as applicable, deemed consent) of such new Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Transactions has been obtained in accordance with this Section 6.15 or (ii) the Company has\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ndisclosed in writing, in accordance with applicable Law, the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of the Transactions to such new Client before such new Client became a Client and, in any case under the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), such new Client has not, prior to Closing, terminated in writing its Investment Advisory Agreement or revoked in writing its consent.   (e)            In connection with obtaining the Client consents and other actions required by this Section 6.15, at all times prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent promptly informed of the status of obtaining such Client consents and, upon Parent\u2019s reasonable request, make available to Parent copies of all such executed Client consents and make available for Parent\u2019s inspection the originals of such consents and any related materials and other records relating to the Client consent process. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the Client consents required under this Section 6.15, Parent and, in the case of any Client of the Wealth Management Business, LPL shall have the right to review in advance of distribution any notices or other materials to be distributed by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to Clients and shall have the right to have its reasonable commented reflected therein prior to distribution. In no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary be required to offer or grant any material accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or otherwise) in respect of any Client for the purpose of obtaining the Client consents contemplated by this Section 6.15.   (f)            Each party hereto shall (i) reasonably cooperate with and assist each other party hereto and their respective Affiliates in connection with obtaining the approvals and consents sought pursuant to this Section 6.15, and (ii) promptly provide to the other applicable parties in writing all information concerning such party and its Affiliates as is reasonably required or otherwise reasonably requested in order to solicit each Public Fund Board and otherwise seek to obtain the approvals and consents to be sought pursuant to this Section 6.15 (including all information as is customarily included in such solicitations, or requests for approvals and consents, prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement).   Section 6.16          Conversion Consents. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the consent of each Client (other than a Fund) for (x) the transfer of Client assets from the Company\u2019s transfer agent Subsidiary or third-party custodian, as applicable, to LPL (or its designated Affiliate) and (y) the transfer of the brokerage and advisory services provided to such Clients from Waddell & Reed, Inc. to LPL (or its designated Affiliate), in each case in connection with the Wealth Management Transactions (the \u201c Conversion\u201d). In furtherance thereof, except in the case of any Client for whom affirmative consent is required under applicable Law or the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following FINRA\u2019s approval of the applicable consent letters, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, send a written notice (the \u201cConversion Negative Consent Notice\u201d), in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable brokerage agreement or the Investment Advisory Agreement, which notice shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to such Clients informing each Client: (a) of the Conversion; (b) of the intention of LPL to complete the Conversion, which will result in an assignment of such brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement and the transfer of such Client\u2019s account to LPL; (c) of the intention of LPL to provide brokerage, advisory or custody services pursuant to the existing brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after the Conversion if such Client does not terminate its brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement prior to the Conversion; and (d) that the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client does not terminate its brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, within 45 calendar days after the sending of the Conversion Negative Consent Notice (or such longer period as may be required under the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement). If the applicable brokerage agreement, Investment Advisory Agreement or applicable Law requires the written consent of the Client to the assignment of such Client\u2019s brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or if the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary determines, in its discretion, that for commercial reasons it would be prudent or appropriate to obtain the written consent of a Client to such assignment, then the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, send a written notice, in accordance with applicable Law, and the applicable brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, which notice shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, informing such Client of the Conversion and requesting written consent to the assignment of such Client\u2019s brokerage agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement.

(b)            For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Parent shall not engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that would constitute an \u201cassignment\u201d (as that term is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) to a third party of any Investment Advisory Agreement between Parent or any of its Affiliates and any Public Fund, without first using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the counterparty to such transaction a covenant in all material respects comparable to that contained in this Section 6.17; provided, however, that if Parent or any of its Affiliates obtains an exemptive order from the SEC as contemplated by Section 15(f)(3) of the Investment Company Act, then this covenant shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to permit Parent and its Affiliates to act in a manner consistent with such SEC exemptive order.

Section 9.15            Parent Guaranty.   (a)            To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Company the full, complete and timely payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub (each of Parent and Merger Sub, a \u201cParent Party\u201d) of each and every obligation, Liability, covenant and other agreement of any Parent Party in this Agreement (excluding the investment advisory agreements and the interim investment advisory agreements, if any, between Affiliates of the Parent Parties and the Public Funds or other Clients, as applicable, and all of the obligations of the Parent Parties thereunder), in each case as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (collectively, the \u201cParent Guaranteed Obligations\u201d), in each case whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any Parent Guaranteed Obligation or operated as a discharge thereof (the \u201cParent Guaranty\u201d).   (b)            Parent Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of performance and of payment when due of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations and not just of collection, and Parent Guarantor waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Person to enforce any of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations against any Parent Party or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Parent Guaranty and of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, presentation, demand for payment, dishonor, protest, default notice of non-performance, notice of incurrence of any of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of any Parent Party or any other Person interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally.   \n\n\n94   \n\n\n  (c)            Parent Guarantor agrees that the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of Parent Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, and may also make any agreement with any Parent Party for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or affecting Parent Guarantor\u2019s obligations under this Agreement. Parent Guarantor agrees that the Parent Guaranty or the Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released, discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of any Person to assert any claim, make any demand, or enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any Parent Party or any other Person, whether under this Agreement or otherwise; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any Parent Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition or substitution of any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, to or from this Agreement; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Parent Party; (v) any amendment or modification to, or waiver of, the terms of this Agreement; (vi) the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up of, or any similar or analogous event involving or affecting, any Parent Party; (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right that Parent Guarantor may have at any time against any Parent Party or the Company, whether in connection with the Parent Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; (viii) the adequacy of any other means Parent may have of obtaining payment or performance of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations; or (ix) any other event or condition that, but for the provisions hereof, would constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of Parent Guarantor hereunder.   (d)            The Parent Guaranteed Obligations shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, claim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise.   (e)            The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Parent Guaranteed Obligations in the event that any Parent Party becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect Parent Guarantor\u2019s obligations hereunder. Parent Guarantor agrees that the Parent Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case maybe, if at any time payment or performance of any Parent Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Parent Party.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)            To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, agrees not to assert or otherwise take advantage of any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against any Parent Party, including rights arising from the existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of Parent Guarantor\u2019s obligations under or in respect of the Parent Guaranty, this Agreement, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Company against any Parent Party, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under Contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from such Parent Party, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, until the full and indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations. In addition to the foregoing, Parent Guarantor subordinates all of the rights referred to in this Section 9.15(f) until the full and indefeasible payment and performance in full of the Parent Guaranteed Obligations.   \n\n\n95   \n\n\n  (g)            No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any such right, remedy or power hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed to it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective stockholders:   (a)            Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cMerger Sub Common Stock\u201d), shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 (the \u201cSurviving Corporation Common Stock\u201d). From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.   (b)            Each Company Common Share and each Company Preferred Share that is owned by (x) Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or (y) the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (including treasury shares) shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.   (c)            Subject to Section 2.1(d), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.2, each issued and outstanding Company Common Share (other than Company Common Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Appraisal Shares), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $32.00 in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), and such certificated Company Common Share and the certificate that formerly represented such Company Common Share (a \u201cCertificate\u201d) or such non-certificated Company Common Share in book-entry form (\u201cBook- Entry Shares\u201d), as the case may be, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration per Company Common Share represented thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the Merger Consideration, immediately prior to and in connection with the Closing, holders of Company Common Shares will receive the Special Dividend as contemplated by Section 5.20   (d)            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent terms, as the case may be, including the Special Dividend Amount, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   \n\n\n 3  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e)            As of the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cCompany Series A Preferred Stock\u201d), Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cCompany Series B Preferred Stock\u201d), Series C Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cCompany Series C Preferred Stock\u201d), and Series D Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cCompany Series D Preferred Stock,\u201d and, together with the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the Company Series B Preferred Stock and the Company Series C Preferred Stock, the \u201cCompany Preferred Stock\u201d) shall remain issued and outstanding without variation.   (f)             Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares and shares of Company Series D Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such Person\u2019s right to appraisal of such shares (\u201cAppraisal Shares\u201d) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d) shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1, or, in the case of the Company Series D Preferred Stock, remain outstanding as contemplated by Section 2.1(e), but rather shall entitle the holders thereof only to such rights as are granted by Section 262; provided; however, if the holder of any such shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then such shares shall cease to be Appraisal Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration provided in this Section 2.1, or, in the case of the Company Series D Preferred Stock, remain outstanding as contemplated by Section 2.1(e). The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or commit to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   Section 2.2             Exchange of Company Common Shares.   (a)            At the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the transfer agent for the Company Common Shares or another nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) all of the cash necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 (such cash provided to the Paying Agent, being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cPayment Fund\u201d). The Paying Agent shall promptly deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Payment Fund to each holder of Company Common Shares who has surrendered its certificates in respect of the Company Common Shares, if applicable, and delivered a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, if applicable; provided that no such delivery shall be required in respect of a holder of Company Common Shares until at least the third (3rd) Business Day following surrender of such certificates and delivery of such Letter of Transmittal by such a holder, in each case, if required pursuant to Section 2.2. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to pay the portion of the Merger Consideration that remains payable (including as a result of any losses resulting from the investments contemplated in Section 2.2(g)), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency.   \n\n\n 4  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)            Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Company Common Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (the \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and matters relating thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the aggregate number of Company Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to Section 2.1(e), until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or any letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon receipt by the Paying Agent of any customary transmission or materials required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.   (c)            The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II upon conversion of any Company Common Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Shares. After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.2(c) does not affect the right of holders of record of issued and outstanding Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time to receive, in connection with the consummation of the Merger and as consideration in connection therewith, the Special Dividend pursuant to the terms of Section 5.20.   \n\n\n 5  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d)            Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or, at the option of Parent, delivered to Parent) free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto other than that holders of Company Common Shares that have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, therefor for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.   (e)            None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 2.2(d)) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (f)            In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this ARTICLE II had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.   (g)            The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis or hold as cash or in a savings deposit or similar account at the direction of Parent; provided, however, if any such investment is directed by Parent, any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better b y Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\u2019s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available); provided, further, no monetary losses on such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II, in the amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Payment Fund is insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration that remains payable. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (h)            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including the Special Dividend, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d) or under any provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law; provided, however, Parent shall, as soon as practicable prior to the Effective Time: (a) provide prompt notice to the Company upon determining any withholding is required and (b) cooperate with the Company to minimize the amount of any applicable deduction or withholding, including by providing reasonable opportunity to provide such documentation or take any other actions necessary to reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amount deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and, in the case of any amounts withheld from any payments not consisting entirely of cash, Parent shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.   \n\n\n 6  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Section 2.3             Treatment of Company Stock Awards.

(b)           As of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a \u201cCompany RSU\u201d), which was granted prior to the date hereof, regardless of whether vested or unvested, shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and, in exchange therefor in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, through their respective payroll systems, to pay each former holder of any such cancelled Company RSU on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time, that is no less than three (3) Business Days thereafter, an amount in cash (without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding of Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Total Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU.

Each Adjusted RSU Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions applicable to the Assumed Company RSU under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting, settlement and acceleration.   \n\n\n 7  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall take all actions necessary (including adopting such resolutions as are necessary) to effect the treatment of the Company Stock Options and the Company RSUs (collectively, the \u201cCompany Stock Awards\u201d) as contemplated by this Section 2.3.   (e)            Parent shall file with the SEC, following the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the shares of Parent common stock issuable with respect to the Assumed Company RSUs.

(e)            Notwithstanding Section 5.2(d), and subject to Section 5.2(f), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may in response to a Company Superior Proposal received on or after the date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.2, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) (including by concurrently paying the Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Company Superior Proposal. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or cause the Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Company Superior Proposal unless the Company has first complied with the provisions of Section 5.2(f) and, after so complying, the Company Board determines in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal.   \n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (f)            The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in Section 5.2(e) unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a \u201cNotice of Company Superior Proposal\u201d) advising Parent that the Company has received a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Company Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect such Company Superior Proposal and that the Company Board has made the determination that the Company Acquisition Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) caused the Company and its Representatives to be available to negotiate, during the four (4) Business Day period following Parent\u2019s receipt of the Notice of Company Superior Proposal (the \u201cCompany Superior Proposal Notice Period\u201d), in good faith with Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer or propose to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the extent Parent wishes to do so) so that such Company Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, and (iii) after complying with the immediately foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), reaffirmed the Company Board\u2019s determination required under Section 5.2(e) in light of any counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, if, during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period any revisions are made to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice of Company Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(f) with respect to such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal, except that any subsequent Company Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days following Parent\u2019s receipt of such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, delivery and receipt of a Notice of Company Superior Proposal shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.   (g)           Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board, in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company has first: (i) provided written notice to Parent (a \u201cNotice of Company Intervening Event\u201d) describing the Company Intervening Event and advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail; (ii) caused the Company and its Representatives to be available to negotiate, during the four (4) Business Days following Parent\u2019s receipt of the Notice of Company Intervening Event (the \u201cCompany Intervening Event Notice Period\u201d), in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent in response to such Company Intervening Event (to the extent Parent wishes to do so); and (iii) at the end of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent), that a Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.   (h)           Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, provided that this Section 5.2(h) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by Section 5.2(d); provided, further that, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), the Company Board reaffirms its recommendation of the Transaction within three (3) days of any such communication.   \n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Section 5.3             Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting.   (a)            As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, a preliminary version of a proxy statement relating to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of the Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, whether preliminary or definitive, the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d). Parent shall cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the SEC. Except as required by applicable Law, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without Parent\u2019s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, in any case, without providing Parent the opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company will advise Parent promptly after it receives any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide Parent with copies of any written communication received from the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC by the Company, after Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the staff of the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that it does not intend to review the Proxy Statement, the Company will file a definitive version of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive version of the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock.   (b)           Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.2(d), the Company shall, (i) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than forty-five (45) days) following the date on which the definitive version of the Proxy Statement is first mailed to holders of the Company Common Stock, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCompany Stockholder Meeting\u201d) for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) through the Company Board, recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock adopt this Agreement (the \u201cCompany Recommendation\u201d), (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall have the right, after good faith consultation with Parent, to, and shall at the request of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting for no longer than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate (A) for the absence of a quorum, or (B) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time, taking into account the amount of time until the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company has not received a number of proxies that would reasonably be believed to be sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.   \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Section 5.4             Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to contractual and legal restrictions applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be, to all of their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (including the work papers of independent accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such independent accountants) and, during such period, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other may reasonably request, in each case, for reasonable business purposes related to the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, such access does not unreasonably disrupt the ordinary course operations of the Acquired Companies. No access, materials, information or investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party or any condition to the obligations of the parties. This Section 5.4 shall not require any Acquired Company to permit any access, or to disclose any materials or information, that in the reasonable judgment of such party would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality under any Contract or Law (provided that party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) result in the loss of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege with respect to such materials or information or (iii) in the case of documents or portions of documents relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive, result in a violation of applicable Law (including a Governmental Entity alleging that providing such information violates any Regulatory Law). If any material is withheld by a party pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other as to the general nature of what is being withheld and use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. All materials and information exchanged or to which access is granted pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2020 (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d), between the Company and Parent.   \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Section 5.5             Further Action; Efforts.

(b)            Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with and without limiting the obligations to use certain efforts referenced in Section 5.5(a), to the extent relating to the requisite approvals, authorizations and clearances for the Transactions under the HSR Act and the other Regulatory Laws and the Insurance Laws, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), any Insurance Regulator or any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other a reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting, discussion or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, any Insurance Regulator or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Action by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, such Insurance Regulator or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, as applicable, give the other the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and conferences solely to the extent such meetings, discussions and conference relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, and (iv) to the extent practicable and subject to the other provisions in this Section 5.5, attempt to confer in good faith in order to (A) exchange and review respective views and positions with the other as to potential Materially Burdensome Conditions and (B) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable Governmental Entity regarding any approaches or actions that could mitigate the scope or impact of a potential Materially Burdensome Condition so that it does not become a Materially Burdensome Condition. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite approval, authorization or clearance for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval, authorization or clearance or Requisite Regulatory Approval will be materially delayed or conditioned or impose or require a Materially Burdensome Condition. The parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, including reasonable access to any materials submitted in connection with any proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable Regulatory Law, including any proceeding under 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 803.20.

Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel for matters relating to Regulatory Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates, unless express permission is obtained in advance from the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or its outside legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective outside legal counsel for matters relating to Regulatory Law to comply with this Section 5.5(b).   \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c)            Without limiting any other obligations of Parent hereunder, Parent will respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions and will use its reasonable best efforts to take any and all action necessary to ensure that each requisite approval, authorization or clearance under the HSR Act and each Requisite Regulatory Approval is obtained by the Outside Date, in each case, without imposing or requiring a Materially Burdensome Condition.   (d)            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Parent Company shall be obligated to, and no Acquired Company shall, without the prior written consent of Parent at its sole discretion, consent to, take or refrain from taking, or offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from taking (A) any action that involves (i) making any divestiture or disposition of any portion of any business or assets, (ii) licensing any portion of any business or assets, (iii) accepting or entering any consent decree or hold separate order, (iv) placing any assets in trust, in each case by Parent or any of the other Parent Companies or the Company or any of the other Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, (v) accepting or entering into any operational restriction or restriction on the payment or declaration of dividends, (vi) making any capital commitment or capital guaranty, (vii) entering into any capital support agreement, statement of support, guarantee, keep well or other similar capital maintenance undertaking to maintain a minimum risk-based capital level or rating, or (B) any other action with respect to, or in connection with, Parent or the other Parent Companies or the Company or the other Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above, which, individually or together with any other such action, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when considered together with the business lines of Parent and its Subsidiaries that, as of the date hereof, Parent intends to integrate with the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing, or (y) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that, for this purpose, the business, financial condition, results of operations and financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be as of the same scale as the entities described in the foregoing clause (x)) (any such action, a \u201cMaterially Burdensome Condition\u201d).   \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall a party or any of its Affiliates be required by a Governmental Entity to agree to take, or enter into any action with respect to their respective assets, businesses or Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.5, which action is not conditioned upon the Closing.   Section 5.6             Employee Benefits Matters.   (a)            For a period commencing at the Effective Time through December 31, 2021 (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant employee) (the \u201cContinuation Period\u201d), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of any of the Acquired Companies as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cContinuing Employee\u201d), (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate at least equivalent to the base salary or hourly wage rate in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) a target bonus opportunity that is at least equivalent to such Continuing Employee\u2019s target bonus opportunity as in effect for fiscal year 2020 (which may be settled in cash, equity or a combination thereof as determined by Parent in its sole discretion), (iii) employee benefits substantially comparable to either, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion, the respective levels as in effect under the Company Plans (other than any equity compensation, change in control, retention, non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement, defined benefit plan or retiree health or welfare arrangement) immediately prior to the Closing or the employee benefits (other than any equity compensation, change in control, retention, non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement, defined benefit plan or retiree health or welfare arrangement) made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time, and (iv) with respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (but not including any Continuing Employee who has entered into an individualized agreement providing for severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment), severance benefits that are no less than the severance benefits set forth in Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, taking into account all service with the Company in determining the amount of severance benefits payable, subject to such Continuing Employee\u2019s execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Parent and its Affiliates in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent that becomes effective and non-revocable within sixty (60) days following such termination.   \n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)            Parent hereby acknowledges that a \u201cchange in control\u201d (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Plans will occur at the Effective Time.   (c)            Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to be provided full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries as was credited under similar or comparable Company Plans for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Plans (other than any equity-incentive plans), but not for eligibility or benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plan or non-qualified deferred compensation plan of any of the Parent Companies or for purposes of determining eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits, and (ii) determination of benefit levels under any Parent Plan or policy of general application relating to vacation or, following the Continuation Period, severance, in either case to the extent the Continuing Employees is eligible to participate, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion, but except: (x) where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits; (y) to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to Closing; or (z) to the extent that such service is not recognized under such Parent Plan for other similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates. In addition, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to: (A) waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods and similar exclusions, to the same extent such limitations, exclusions and requirements would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the terms of any comparable medical and dental plan of the Acquired Companies; and (B) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the similar or comparable Company Plans to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying all deductibles, co-payments, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and similar expenses applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable similar or comparable Parent Plan during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.   (d)            Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans, to permit the rollover of plan benefits into, or participation in, a Parent benefit plan or to continue the employment of any specific individual. The provisions of this Section 5.6 are for the sole benefit of the parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, labor unions, directors or independent contractors of any of the Acquired Companies or, on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.   \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e)            Upon Parent\u2019s reasonable request from time to time prior to Closing, the Company shall, a reasonable period of time following receipt of such request (but in no event more than ten (10) Business days following such request), provide Parent with the then-most recent calculations and reasonable back-up information relating to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code relating to the Merger, including any non-compete valuations.   (f)             401(k) Plan. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Company Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the \u201c401(k) Plans\u201d), unless Parent or one of its Affiliates, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain such 401(k) Plans by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least ten (10) days before the Closing. Unless Parent or one of its Affiliates provides such notice to the Company, Parent shall receive from the Company, prior to the Closing, evidence that the Company Board or its applicable Affiliate has adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably require and Parent shall take all necessary and legally permissible actions to direct its or one of its Affiliate\u2019s defined contribution plan to accept the rollover of any \u201celigible rollover distribution\u201d (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan. If Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan, the Company shall amend such 401(k) Plan, effective as of the Closing, to the extent necessary to limit participation to employees of the Company and to exclude all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) from participation in the such plan.   (g)            Subject to applicable Law and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause each of the Acquired Companies to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to facilitate (i) the integration of personnel between the Acquired Companies promptly following the Closing, and (ii) the transfer of employment of certain employees of Parent or its Affiliates to the Acquired Companies as of immediately following the Closing.   Section 5.7             Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written communication received from any Person alleging that it or any other Person is or may be required to obtain a consent of such first-mentioned Person in connection with the Transactions or a consent from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not (a) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement, (b) limit the remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice or (c) be construed in any way as an admission that such consent is required.   Section 5.8\u202f            Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a)            Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational documents and any indemnification or other agreements of the Acquired Companies with any of the current or former directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of each Acquired Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other comparable organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Acquired Companies with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of any of the Acquired Companies; provided, however, all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Action.   \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)            From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under the Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) each current and former director or officer of any of the Acquired Companies (each such individual, together with such individual\u2019s heirs, executors or administrators, an \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d), in each case against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   (c)            At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid (or \u201ctail\u201d) directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, that does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time and that is no less favorable with respect to limits, deductibles and other terms compared to the Company\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance and indemnification policies or, if such insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available similar coverage (the \u201cContinuing D&O Insurance\u201d); provided, however, the premium for the Continuing D&O Insurance shall not exceed the amount set forth on Section 5.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (in which such case the Company shall purchase Continuing D&O Insurance that provides the maximum coverage available at such an amount of premium).   \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d)            If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.   (e)            The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.8 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of any of the Acquired Companies or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each case in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or under applicable Law. Except as otherwise set forth herein, these rights shall survive consummation of the Merger in accordance with their terms and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.   Section 5.9             Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide to Parent copies of the resolutions to be adopted by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to implement the foregoing.   Section 5.10           Takeover Statutes. The Company and its board of directors shall (a) grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other Transactions) and (b) if any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other Transactions), grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Law on such transactions.   Section 5.11           Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\u2019s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.   Section 5.12           Certain Litigation. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of any Action commenced after the date of this Agreement against any Acquired Company, Parent Company or any of their respective directors or officers by any stockholder arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and shall keep the other reasonably informed regarding any such Action. The Company and Parent shall give the other party the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any such Action, shall keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to any material developments regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and shall give due consideration to the other party\u2019s advice with respect to such stockholder Action. The Company shall not settle or offer to settle any such Action, without the prior written consent of Parent (in its sole discretion); provided that Parent shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay such consent so long as (a) such settlement is solely for monetary damages, (b) in connection therewith the Company does not (1) disparage Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of the respective Affiliates or businesses of the foregoing or the impact or effect of the Transactions or (2) disclose competitively sensitive information of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of the respective Affiliates or businesses of the foregoing; and (c) if Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective directors or officers is a named party in such Action, such Person receives a full and complete release on terms no less favorable than those received by the Company).   \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Section 5.13           Public Announcements. The initial press release issued by Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be in a form agreed to by Parent and the Company and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other and obtain the other\u2019s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement (including scheduling of a press conference or conference call with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, except (a) as may be required by applicable Law, court process or listing agreement with any national securities exchange if the party issuing such press release or other public statement has, to the extent practicable, provided the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such press release or other public statement, (b) any press release or other public statement that is consistent in all material respects with previous press releases and public statements made by a party in accordance with this Agreement, in each case under this clause (b) to the extent the disclosure contained therein remains current and accurate, (c) in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal made in accordance with this Agreement and (d) in connection with any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement.

(a)            During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, at Parent\u2019s sole expense, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent all cooperation and information reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary and customary in connection with the arrangement of any financing obtained to fund the Merger Consideration or any other fees or expenses related to the Transactions (the \u201cFinancing\u201d).

Section 8.7             No Third Party Beneficiaries.

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.   Section 8.9         Jurisdiction; Enforcement. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any Action with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any Judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). The parties further agree that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.9, and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.9, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 8.2 and agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the respective addresses set forth in Section 8.2 shall be effective service of process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.   Section 8.10      Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.   Section 8.11     Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, as a whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided, however, Parent or Merger Sub may assign in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.   \n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n Section 8.12       Remedies. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. Accordingly, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity and no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby further waives any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.   Section 8.13       Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 8.14       Disclosure Letters. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub except and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item is material or that such item is reasonably likely to materially impair the ability of a party to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the Transactions, in each case, on or before the Outside Date. Descriptive headings in the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for convenience of the reader only and shall not affect the interpretation thereof or of this Agreement. Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of liability or responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or future matter or proceeding. Any disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter of information that is also filed with or disclosed in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document, as applicable, shall not be deemed a representation that there is no other information filed with or disclosed in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document, as applicable, that would qualify the corresponding representation. Any Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify a representation or warranty only if it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such information is relevant to such representation or warranty. All disclosures in the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are intended only to allocate rights and risks between the parties to the Agreement and are not intended to be admissions against interests, be admissible against any party by any Person who is not a party (other than Affiliates, beneficiaries, or successors or assigns of any of the parties), or give rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a party (other than Affiliates, beneficiaries, or successors or assigns of any of the parties).   \n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n Section 8.15       Counterparts; Execution. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

For purposes of this Agreement \u201cClosing Date\u201d shall mean the date on which the Closing occurs.   (b)               As soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Secretary of State\u201d) a certificate of merger (the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d) and filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the \u201cMaryland Department\u201d) articles of merger (the \u201cArticles of Merger,\u201d together with the Certificate of Merger, the \u201cMerger Filings\u201d) in connection with the Merger, each in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the Delaware LLC Act and MGCL, respectively, and the parties shall make all other filings or recordings required under the Delaware LLC Act and MGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time specified in the Merger Filings (not to exceed 30 days after the later of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Maryland Department), and following the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and the filing of Articles of Merger with the Maryland Department (such date and time the Merger becomes effective, the \u201cEffective Time\u201d).   2.3              Effect of the Merger.

At the Effective Time, the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended, subject to Section 6.10(b), in accordance with their respective terms and applicable Law.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n5   \n\n\n  2.5              Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, the managers and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the managers and officers of the Surviving Company, and such managers and officers shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company.   2.6              Directors of Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate action so that upon and immediately after the Effective Time, the size of the Parent Board is increased by one member, and Dominique Mielle (the \u201cCompany Director Designee\u201d) is appointed to the Parent Board; provided that the Company Director Designee has provided a satisfactorily completed directors\u2019 questionnaires to Parent prior to such appointment. In the event that the Company Director Designee is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board prior to the Effective Time, then a substitute who is a current independent director of the Company shall be designated by the Company on the earlier to occur of (a) five Business Days after the date that the Company Director Designee is determined to be unable to serve or informs the Company that she is unwilling to serve and (b) the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, which substitute member shall be deemed to be a Company Director Designee for purposes of this Agreement. Any such substitute Company Director Designee shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent Board.

provided, however, that (1) no non-public information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to Section 6.4(b) may be furnished until Parent receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent that are no less favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Parent Board in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel; provided, further, that such confidentiality agreement does not contain provisions that prohibit Parent from complying with the provisions of this Section 6.4, and (2) prior to taking any such actions, the Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Competing Proposal is, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal;   (iii)             prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Parent Competing Proposal from a third party that was not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement and did not arise from a material breach of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4, if the Parent Board so chooses, cause Parent to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, if prior to taking such action (A) the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Parent Competing Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Competing Proposal); and (B) Parent shall have given notice to the Company that Parent has received such proposal in accordance with Section 6.4(c),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nspecifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and, that Parent intends to take such action, and either (1) the Company shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such notice is given to the Company, or (2) if the Company within the period described in the foregoing clause (1) shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by Parent, the Parent Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Parent Competing Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal with respect to the Company\u2019s revised proposal; provided, however, that each time material modifications to the financial terms of a Parent Competing Proposal determined to be a Parent Superior Proposal are made, the time period set forth in this clause (B) prior to which Parent may effect a Parent Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for two Business Days after notification of such change to the Company; and   \n\n\n52   \n\n\n  (iv)             prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, seek clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-public information to) any Person that has made a Parent Competing Proposal that was not solicited at any time following the execution of this Agreement solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide adequate information for the Parent Board or any committee thereof to make an informed determination under Section 6.4(d)(ii).   (e)           Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, other than in response to a Parent Competing Proposal (which is addressed in Section 6.4(d)(iii)), to make a Parent Change of Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, (i) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its legal duties as directors under applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall have given notice to the Company that Parent intends to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation (which notice will reasonably describe the reasons for such Parent Change of Recommendation), and either (A) the Company shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such notice is given to the Company, or (B) if the Company within the period described in the foregoing clause (A) shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the need for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation and that the failure to make a Parent Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its legal duties as directors under applicable Law.   6.5           Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement.   (a)           Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of Parent Capital Stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company will promptly furnish to Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of Company Capital Stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Registration Statement (including the Joint Proxy Statement) and any amendments or supplements thereto.   \n\n\n53   \n\n\n  (b)           Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or the Transactions; and provided, further that the Company, in connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, or Parent, in connection with any Parent Change of Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) and make other filings with the SEC, to effect such Company Change of Recommendation or Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable.   (c)            Parent and the Company each shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable blue sky laws and, in each case, the rules and regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.   \n\n\n54   \n\n\n  (d)           If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nofficers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders and the Parent Stockholders.   6.6           Stockholders Meetings.   (a)            The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC. Except as permitted by Section 6.3, the Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Stockholders that they vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and the other Transactions at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger and the other Transactions, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board has resolved to make the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to establish a quorum at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Company Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) exist, and such Company Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clause (ii) exist); and provided, further, that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two Business Days prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second Business Day after the expiration of any of the periods contemplated by Section 6.3(d)(iii)(B). If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent all voting tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the Company\u2019s transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the Company\u2019s obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.6(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Company Superior Proposal or Company Competing Proposal, or by any Company Change of Recommendation.   \n\n\n55   \n\n\n    (b)               Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC. Except as permitted by Section 6.4, the Parent, through the Parent Board, shall recommend to the Parent Stockholders that they vote in favor of the Parent Common Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Board shall solicit from Parent Stockholders proxies in favor of the Parent Common Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Parent Board has resolved to make the Parent Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parent Stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to establish a quorum at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) exist, and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clause (ii) exist); and provided, further, that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two Business Days prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second Business Day after the expiration of any of the periods contemplated by Section 6.4(d)(iii)(B). If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by Parent or Parent\u2019s transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Parent\u2019s obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.6(b) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Parent Superior Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal, or by any Parent Change of Recommendation.   (c)               The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting on the same day.   \n\n\n56   \n\n\n  6.7            Access to Information.   (a)               Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its Representatives, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, any other employees, and offices of such party and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other party and its Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as such other party may reasonably request, including information about the Company\u2019s financing, hedging activities, portfolio risk and portfolio activities. Each of the Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other party that may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7(a), each party shall not be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to the other party or any of its Representatives to the extent that (i) such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or other legal privilege or (ii) such access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement or a contract or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nagreement entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.   (b)               The Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2020, between Parent and the Company (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c)               Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Manager and each Affiliate of the Company Manager to deliver to the Company all contracts and records in the Company Manager\u2019s or any of its Affiliates\u2019 possession or control to the extent (with respect to the contracts) they are contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, and with respect to records, to the extent they pertain to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such records shall not include records that are the owned property of the Company Manager and are not owned property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   6.8              Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a)               Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this Section 6.8, to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.   \n\n\n57   \n\n\n  (b)               In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall give any required notices to third parties, and each of the parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required filings or submissions with any Governmental Entity and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties and their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the parties shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental Entity.   (c)               In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the Merger, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person without the prior written consent of Parent. The parties shall cooperate to obtain such consents.   6.9              Employee Matters. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.   \n\n\n58   \n\n\n  6.10          Indemnification; Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance.   (a)               Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined below) may have pursuant to the Company\u2019s Organizational Documents, any employment agreement or any indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise (which agreements shall be assumed by Parent and the Surviving Company), from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (the \u201cIndemnified Persons\u201d) against and from all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys\u2019 and other professionals\u2019 fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (\u201cIndemnified Liabilities\u201d), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case, to the extent any such Indemnified Person is entitled to be so indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company\u2019s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) the Surviving Company shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Company (provided, that the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party\u2019s position with respect to such claims). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, (i) shall not be liable for any settlement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\neffected without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Company the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto, if any.   (b)               Parent and the Surviving Company shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would affect) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or employees existing on the date of this Agreement.   \n\n\n59   \n\n\n  (c)               The Company shall put in place, and fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\u2019s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.   (d)               In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or such Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. Parent and the Surviving Company shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or the Surviving Company unable to satisfy their obligations under this Section 6.10. The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 6.10, and his, her or its heirs and representatives. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.10 are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent and the Surviving Company shall pay all expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10.   6.11          Stockholder Litigation. In the event any Transaction Litigation is commenced, the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Each party shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consider in good faith the other party\u2019s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation; provided, that the Company shall not agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.   6.12          Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by the parties. From and after the date hereof, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates or Subsidiaries, nor the Parent Manager, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such party\u2019s capital stock is traded to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions, including the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto or (b) in the case of the Company or Parent, it deems it necessary or appropriate to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions in connection with or following a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation, respectively; provided, however, each party and their respective controlled Affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section 6.12.   \n\n\n60   \n\n\n  6.13          Control of Business. Without limiting in any way any party\u2019s rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other party and their respective Subsidiaries\u2019 operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 respective operations.   6.14          Transfer Taxes. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.

The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay the Termination Fee.

The par value of the Series B Preferred Stock is $.0001 per share. The number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be 1,919,378.   (2)               Rank. The Series B Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank (i) prior or senior to any class or series of common stock of the Corporation and any other class or series of equity securities, if the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such class or series (\u201cJunior Stock\u201d); (ii) on a parity with any class or series of the equity securities of the Corporation if, pursuant to the specific terms of such class or series of equity securities, the holders of such class or series of equity securities and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to the receipt of dividends and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid dividends per share or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other (\u201cParity Stock\u201d); (iii) junior to any class or series of equity securities of the Corporation if, pursuant to the specific terms of such class or series, the holders of such class or series are entitled to the receipt of dividends or amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in preference or priority to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock (\u201cSenior Stock\u201d); and (iv) junior to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the Corporation. The term \u201cequity securities\u201d does not include convertible debt securities, which will rank senior to the Series B Preferred Stock.   \n\n\n    \n\n\n  (3)               Dividends.   (a)               Holders of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board and declared by the Corporation, out of funds legally available for payment, cash dividends at the rate of 8.625% per annum on the $25.00 liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.15625 per annum per share). Such dividends will be cumulative from [ \u2022 ], 20211, whether or not in any dividend period or periods (i) such dividends shall be declared, (ii) there shall be funds legally available for the payment of such dividends or (iii) any agreement prohibits payment of such dividends, and such dividends shall be payable quarterly the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (or, if not a Business Day (as defined in Article VII of the Charter), the next succeeding Business Day), commencing [ \u2022 ], 20212. Any dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period will be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. Dividends will be payable in arrears to holders of record as they appear on the records of the Corporation at the close of business on the last day of each of March, June, September and December, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable dividend payment date. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends in excess of cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at the dividend rate specified in this paragraph. No interest will be paid in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series B Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.   (b)               When dividends are not paid in full upon the Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Parity Stock, or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, all dividends declared upon the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated, accrued and unpaid on the Series B Preferred Stock and accumulated, accrued and unpaid on such Parity Stock. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, unless dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock equal to the full amount of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment with respect to any class or series of Parity Stock. Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than dividends paid in Junior Stock or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase such Junior Stock) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment with respect to any Junior Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock or Parity Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (except for purposes of an employee benefit plan) for any consideration, or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion or exchange for Junior Stock, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase Junior Stock), nor shall any other cash or property be paid or distributed to or for the benefit of holders of Junior Stock or Parity Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be prohibited from (i) declaring or paying or setting apart for payment any dividend or distribution on any Parity Stock or (ii) redeeming, purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Junior Stock or Parity Stock, in each case, if such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition is necessary to maintain the Corporation\u2019s qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\npurposes (\u201cREIT\u201d).     \n\n\n  1 To be the last dividend payment date before the Effective Time of the Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).   2 To be the first dividend payment date after the Effective Time of the Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such date shall be the scheduled dividend payment date for the next succeeding dividend).   \n\n\n2   \n\n\n  (c)               No dividends on Series B Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board or declared or paid or set apart for payment at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement, including any agreement relating to the Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.   (d)               If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as \u201ccapital gain dividends\u201d (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code) any portion of the dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock, then the portion of the capital gains amount that shall be allocable to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock for the year bears to the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of capital stock.   (e)               In determining for purposes of Section 2-311 of the Maryland General Corporation Law or otherwise under the Maryland General Corporation Law whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), by dividend, redemption or otherwise, is permitted, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the liquidation preference of any series of preferred stock with preferential rights on dissolution senior to the Series B Preferred Stock (as discussed in Section 4 below) will not be added to the Corporation\u2019s total liabilities.   (4)               Liquidation Preference.   (a)               Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, before any payment or distribution shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any Junior Stock, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of final distribution to such holders, but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, its assets, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the above described preferential amount and liquidating payments on any other shares of any class or series of Parity Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Stock ratably in the same proportion as the respective amounts that would be payable on such Series B Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Stock if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.   \n\n\n3   \n\n\n  (b)               Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, any other series or class or classes of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.   (c)               Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 or more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series B Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.   (d)               None of a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another entity, a merger of another entity with or into the Corporation, a statutory stock exchange by the Corporation or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s property or business shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.   (e)               The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will not be added to the liabilities of the Corporation for the purpose of determining whether under the Maryland General Corporation Law a distribution may be made to stockholders of the Corporation whose preferential rights upon dissolution of the Corporation are junior to those of holders of Series B Preferred Stock.   (5)               Redemption by Holders. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not redeemable at any time at the option of the holders thereof.   (6)               Redemption by the Corporation.   (a)               Redemption Right   (i)                 The Series B Preferred Stock shall not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter pursuant to which Series B Preferred Stock owned by a stockholder in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit shall automatically be transferred to a Trust for the exclusive benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as provided in Article VII of the Charter.   (ii)              The Corporation, at its option, upon giving notice as provided below, may redeem Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption. The redemption date shall be selected by the Corporation and shall not be less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date notice of redemption is sent. Any date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Section 6 is referred to herein as a \u201cRedemption Date.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n4   \n\n\n  (b)               Limitations on Redemption.   (i)                 If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(a) above, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board and the shares to be redeemed will be selected by the Board pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of such shares held by such holders or by lot or by any other equitable manner as prescribed by the Board. If such redemption is to be by lot and, as a result of such redemption, any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock would Beneficially Own or Constructively Own, in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit because such holder\u2019s shares of Series B Preferred Stock were not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as otherwise provided in the Charter, the Corporation will redeem the requisite number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock from such holder such that he will not hold in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit subsequent to such redemption.   (ii)              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly for any consideration, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of, any shares of Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of any class or series of Junior Stock).   (iii)            The foregoing provisions of subsections 6(b)(i) and (ii) shall not prevent any other action by the Corporation pursuant to the Charter or otherwise in order to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.   \n\n\n5   \n\n\n  (c)               Procedures for Redemption.   (i)                 Notice of redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be mailed to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed by first class mail, postage prepaid at such holder\u2019s address as the same appears on the stock records of the Corporation. Any notice which was mailed as described above shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of the exchange upon which the Series B Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; and (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for cash. Any such redemption may be made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board and as set forth in the notice of redemption.   (ii)              On or after the Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall present and surrender the certificates representing his shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the Corporation at the place designated in the notice of redemption and thereupon the cash redemption price of such shares shall be paid to or on the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.   (iii)            If notice of redemption has been mailed in accordance with Section 6(c)(i) above and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Corporation in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation defaults in payment of the redemption price), all dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption in such notice shall cease to accumulate and all rights of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the redemption price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the Redemption Date), shall cease and terminate and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred (except with the consent of the Corporation) on the Corporation\u2019s books, and such shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. At its election, the Corporation, prior to a Redemption Date, may irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) of the Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and (iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the Redemption Date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to the Redemption Date). Any interest or other earnings earned on the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) deposited with a bank or trust company shall be paid to the Corporation. Any monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the Redemption Date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the Corporation.   \n\n\n6   \n\n\n  (d)               Status of Redeemed Shares. Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular class or series by the Board.   (7)               Voting Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (a)               Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as provided by law and as described below.   (b)               If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not such quarterly periods are consecutive (a \u201cPreferred Dividend Default\u201d), the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (\u201cParity Preferred Stock\u201d)) shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the \u201cPreferred Stock Directors\u201d) who shall each be elected for one-year terms. Such election shall be held at a special meeting called by an officer of the Corporation at the request of the holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock or the holders of shares of any other class or series of Parity Preferred Stock so in arrears, unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders, in which case the vote for such two directors will be held at the earlier of the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series B Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment in full. In such cases, the entire Board automatically shall be increased by two directors. On any matter on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as expressly provided herein or as may be required by law), including any action by written consent, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share, except that when shares of any other series of Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote with the Series B Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, then the Series B Preferred Stock and such other class or series shall have with respect to such matters one vote per $25.00 of stated liquidation preference. With respect to each matter on which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the holder of each share of Series B Preferred Stock may designate a number of proxies equal to the number of votes to which the share is entitled, with each such proxy having the right to vote a whole number of votes on behalf of such holder.   The procedures in this Section 7(b) for the calling of meetings and the election of directors will, to the extent permitted by law, supersede anything inconsistent contained in the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation and, without limitation to the foregoing, the Bylaws of the Corporation will not be applicable to the election of directors by holders of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 7. Notwithstanding the Bylaws of the Corporation, the number of directors constituting the entire Board will be automatically increased to include the directors to be elected pursuant to this Section 7(b).   \n\n\n7   \n\n\n  (c)               If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the current dividend period on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 7(b) herein (subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other classes or series of Parity Preferred Stock, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall be reduced accordingly. So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if there is no such remaining director, by vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other such series of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any other series of Parity Preferred Stock voting as a single class. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter presented to the Board.   (d)               The affirmative vote or consent of at least 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of all other classes or series of preferred stock entitled to vote on such matters, voting as a single class, in addition to any other vote required by the Charter or Maryland law, will be required to: (i) authorize the creation of, the increase in the authorized amount of, or the issuance of any shares of any class of Senior Stock or any security convertible into shares of any class of Senior Stock or (ii) amend, alter or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Charter, including the articles supplementary establishing the Series B Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or other business combination (in any such case, an \u201cEvent\u201d) or otherwise if such action would materially adversely affect the powers, rights or preferences of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock. Neither (i) an amendment of the Charter to authorize, create, or increase the authorized amount of Junior Stock or any shares of any class of Parity Stock, including additional Series B Preferred Stock, nor (ii) an Event, so long as the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such Event the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock. No such vote of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as described above shall be required if provision is made to redeem all Series B Preferred Stock at or prior to the time such amendment, alteration or repeal is to take effect, or when the issuance of any such shares or convertible securities is to be made, as the case may be.   (e)               The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   \n\n\n8   \n\n\n  (8)               Restrictions on Transfer, Acquisition and Redemption of Shares.  The Series B Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Corporation\u2019s Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series B Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series B Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:   \u201cThe Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the Corporation or to its transfer agent.\u201d   (9)               Conversion. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation.   (10)           Settlement. Nothing in this Article Second shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or other securities exchange or an automated inter-dealer quotation system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law.   FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles Supplementary for record.   \n\n\n9   \n\n\n  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer and witnessed by its Secretary on [__________], 2021.

By:   Thomas E. Capasse, Chief Executive Officer   \n\n\n10   \n\n\n        ANNEX C   READY CAPITAL CORPORATION   ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF A SERIES OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK   READY CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (hereinafter called the \u201c Corporation\u201d), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:   FIRST: Under a power contained in Section 2-208 of the Maryland General Corporation Law and Article VI of the Corporation\u2019s charter (the \u201cCharter\u201d), the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the \u201cBoard\u201d) by resolutions duly adopted, classified and designated 779,743 shares of the unissued preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Corporation (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), as 6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and has provided for the issuance of such series. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter.   SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board and the pricing committee thereof, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption, are as follows:   (1)               Designation and Number.  A series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, designated as \u201c6.25% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d), is hereby established. The par value of the Series C Preferred Stock is $.0001 per share. The number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be 779,743.   (2)               Rank. The Series C Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock of the Corporation and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank junior to such Series C Preferred Stock; (b) on parity with the Parity Stock; and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank senior to the Series C Preferred Stock. The term \u201cequity securities\u201d shall not include convertible debt securities. The term \u201cParity Stock\u201d means all classes and series of preferred stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to the payments of distributions and rights to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.   (3)               Dividends.   (a)               Holders of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 6.25% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.5625 per share). Such dividends shall be cumulative from [ \u2022 ], 20211 and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day (each, a \u201cDividend Payment Date\u201d). Any dividend payable on the Series C Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of each of March, June, September and December, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (each, a \u201cDividend Record Date\u201d).     \n\n\n1 To be the last dividend payment date that occurs before the Effective Time of the Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n   \n\n\n  (b)               No dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be declared by the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.   (c)               Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set forth in Section 3(b) hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of dividends, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable.   (d)               Except as provided in Section 3(e) below, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than dividends in shares of Common Stock or dividends in shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or any Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation and except for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter).   (e)               When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on Series C Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.   \n\n\n2   \n\n\n  (f)                Any dividend payment made on shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property or stock in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock as described above.   (4)               Liquidation Preference.   (a)               Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation, legally available for distribution to its stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) to the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation that ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights.   (b)               In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of Parity Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and stockholders of such classes or series of Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.   (c)               After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.   (d)               Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series C Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.   (e)               The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other corporation with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.   \n\n\n3   \n\n\n  (5)               Redemption. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not redeemable at any time by the Corporation or at the option of the holders thereof.   (6)               Conversion.   (a)               Conversion Rights.   (i)                 Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 6, a holder of any share or shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right, at its option, to convert all or any portion of such holder\u2019s outstanding Series C Preferred Stock (the \u201cConversion Right\u201d), subject to the conditions described below, into (i) an amount in cash equal to $[____]2 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (the \u201cConversion Cash\u201d) and (ii) the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nnumber of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock initially at a conversion rate of [____________]3 shares of Common Stock per $25.00 liquidation preference (the \u201cConversion Rate\u201d), which is equivalent to an initial Conversion Price of approximately $[______]4 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7). Such holder shall surrender to the Corporation such shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (b) and (c) of this Section 6, as applicable.   (ii)              In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional interest in an amount equal to the fractional interest multiplied by the Closing Sale Price (as defined below) on a day during which trading in securities generally occurs on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal other United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or, if the Common Stock is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which the Common Stock is then traded (\u201cTrading Day\u201d) immediately prior to the Conversion Date (as defined below) or the Corporation Conversion Option Date (as defined below). If more than one share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock so surrendered. \u201cClosing Sale Price\u201d means with regard to shares of the Common Stock, on any date, the closing sale price per share (or if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices) on such date as reported on the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which shares of the Common Stock are traded (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or, if shares of the Common Stock are not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or in the absence of such a quotation, the Corporation shall determine the closing sale price, in good faith, on the basis of such quotations and other information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment, appropriate.     \n\n\n2 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Per Share Cash Consideration payable in the Merger and (ii) the Conversion Rate applicable to shares of Anworth Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.   3 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Exchange Ratio in the Merger and (ii) the Conversion Rate applicable to shares of Anworth Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.   4 Amount equal to the product of (i) the final Exchange Ratio in the Merger and (ii) the Conversion Price applicable to shares of Anworth Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.   \n\n\n4   \n\n\n  (iii)            A holder of Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to any rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock until that holder has converted its Series C Preferred Stock, and only to the extent the Series C Preferred Stock are deemed to have been converted to shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.   (iv)             The Corporation shall, prior to issuance of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares of Common Stock, all such shares of Series C Preferred Stock would be held by a single holder). The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock shall upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and charges and, except as provided in Section 6(c), taxes with respect to the issue thereof. The Corporation further covenants that, if at any time the shares of Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Global Market and the Nasdaq Capital Market) or quoted on an automated quotation system, the Corporation shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed or quoted, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed or quoted on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. Before the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.   (b)               Corporation Conversion Option.   (i)                 The Corporation shall have the option to require the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock to convert all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into that amount of Conversion Cash and that number of shares of Common Stock that are issuable at the Conversion Rate (as adjusted, the \u201cCorporation Conversion Option\u201d). The Corporation may exercise the Corporation Conversion Option only if the Closing Sale Price equals or exceeds 130% of the Conversion Price of the Series C Preferred Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days (including the last Trading Day of such period), ending on the Trading Day prior to the Corporation\u2019s issuance of a press release announcing its intent to exercise the Corporation Conversion Option in accordance with Section 6(b)(ii).   \n\n\n5   \n\n\n  (ii)              To exercise the Corporation Conversion Option right set forth in this Section 6(b), the Corporation must issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones & Company, Inc., Business Wire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public) prior to the opening of business on the first Trading Day following any date on which the conditions set forth in Section 6(b)(i) shall have been satisfied, announcing the Corporation\u2019s intention to exercise the Corporation Conversion Option. The Corporation shall also give notice by mail or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by mail) to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (\u201cNotice\u201d) (not more than four Trading Days after the date of the press release) of the Corporation Conversion Option announcing the Corporation\u2019s intention to exercise the Corporation Conversion Option. The conversion date (the \u201cCorporation Conversion Option Date\u201d) shall be on the date that is five Trading Days after the date on which the Corporation issues such press release. In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the press release and Notice of a Corporation Conversion Option shall state, as appropriate:   (1)               the Corporation Conversion Option Date;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (2)               the amount of Conversion Cash to be payable and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each Series C Preferred Stock;   (3)               the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted; and   (4)               that dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be converted shall cease to accrue on the Corporation Conversion Option Date.   (iii)            Upon exercise of the Corporation Conversion Option and the surrender of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock by a holder thereof, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or to such other person on such holder\u2019s written order (a) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable full shares of Common Stock to which a holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock being converted, or a holder\u2019s transferee, shall be entitled plus (b) the Conversion Cash plus (c) any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion shall be settled as provided in Section 6(a).   (iv)             Each conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the Corporation Conversion Option Date so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the Series C Preferred Stock being converted shall cease except for the right to receive the Conversion Cash and the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7), and the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of those shares of Common Stock at that time.   \n\n\n6   \n\n\n  (v)               In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of beneficial interest in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) to convert such holder\u2019s beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by a global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.   (vi)             In case any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to this Section 6(b), such holder\u2019s right to voluntarily convert its Series C Preferred Stock shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Corporation Conversion Option Date.   (c)               Conversion Right Procedures.   (i)                 To exercise the Conversion Right as set forth in Section 6(a), a holder of the Series C Preferred Stock must surrender to the Corporation at its principal office or at the office of the transfer agent of the Corporation, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, the certificate or certificates for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice stating that the holder of Series C Preferred Stock elects to convert all or a specified whole number of those shares in accordance with this Section 6(c) and specifying the name or names in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for the shares of Common Stock to be issued (\u201cConversion Notice\u201d). In case the notice specifies that the Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name or names other than that of the holder of Series C Preferred Stock, the notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the payment of the Conversion Cash and the issuance of shares of Common Stock in that name or names. Other than those transfer taxes payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Conversion Cash or shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.   (ii)              As promptly as practicable after the surrender of the certificate or certificates for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 6(c)(i), the receipt of the Conversion Notice and payment of all required transfer taxes, if any, or the demonstration to the Corporation\u2019s satisfaction that those taxes have been paid, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or to such other person on such holder\u2019s written order, (a) the Conversion Cash and certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock being converted, or the holder\u2019s transferee, shall be entitled, (b) if less than the full number of Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates, less the number of shares being converted, and (c) any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion shall be settled as provided in Section 6(a)(ii).   \n\n\n7   \n\n\n  (iii)            Each conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of giving the notice and of surrendering the certificate or certificates representing the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock to be converted (the \u201cConversion Date\u201d) so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the Series C Preferred Stock being converted shall cease except for the right to receive the Conversion Cash and the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate (subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 7), and, if applicable, the person entitled to receive shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of those shares of Common Stock at that time.   (iv)             In lieu of the foregoing procedures, if the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held in global form, each holder of beneficial interest in Series C Preferred Stock must comply with the procedures of DTC to convert such holder\u2019s beneficial interest in respect of the Series C Preferred Stock evidenced by a global share of the Series C Preferred Stock.   (v)               If a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has exercised its right to require the Corporation to repurchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 13 hereof, such holder\u2019s Conversion Rights with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock so subject to repurchase shall expire at 5:00PM, New York City time, on the Trading Day immediately preceding the repurchase date, unless the Corporation defaults on the payment of the purchase price. If a holder of Series C Preferred Stock has submitted any such share for repurchase, such share may be converted only if such holder submits a notice of withdrawal or complies with applicable DTC procedures.   (d)               Payment of Dividends.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(i)                 Optional Conversion.   (A)             If a holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock exercises its Conversion Right, upon delivery of the Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to cumulate dividends as of the end of the day immediately preceding the Conversion Date and the holder shall not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid dividends of the Series C Preferred Stock, except in those limited circumstances discussed in this Section 6(d). Except as provided herein, the Corporation shall make no payment for accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series C Preferred Stock converted at a holder\u2019s election pursuant to a Conversion Right, or for dividends on shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion.   (B)              If the Corporation receives a Conversion Notice before the close of business on a Dividend Record Date, the holder shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the dividend payable on such converted Series C Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.   \n\n\n8   \n\n\n  (C)              If the Corporation receives a Conversion Notice after the Dividend Record Date but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, the holder on the Dividend Record Date shall receive on that Dividend Payment Date accrued dividends on those Series C Preferred Stock, notwithstanding the conversion of those Series C Preferred Stock prior to that Dividend Payment Date, because that holder shall have been the holder of record on the corresponding Divided Record Date. However, at the time that such holder surrenders the Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, the holder shall pay to the Corporation an amount equal to the dividend that has accrued and that shall be paid on the related Dividend Payment Date.   (D)             A holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock on a Dividend Record Date who exercises its Conversion Right and converts such Series C Preferred Stock into Conversion Cash and Common Stock on or after the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such Series C Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date, and the converting holder need not include payment of the amount of such dividend upon surrender for conversion of Series C Preferred Stock.   (ii)              Corporation Conversion Option.   (A)             If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion Option, whether the Corporation Conversion Option Date is prior to, on or after the Dividend Record Date for the current period, all unpaid dividend which are in arrears as of the Corporation Conversion Option Date shall be payable to the holder of the Series C Preferred Stock.   (B)              If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion Option and the Corporation Conversion Option Date is a date that is prior to the close of business on any Dividend Record Date, the holder shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the dividend payable for such period on such converted shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.   (C)              If the Corporation exercises the Corporation Conversion Option and the Corporation Conversion Option Date is a date that is on, or after the close of business on, any Dividend Record Date and prior to the close of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, all dividends, including accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock called for conversion on such date, shall be payable on such Dividend Payment Date to the record holder of such shares on such record date.   (7)               Adjustment of Conversion Rate.   (a)               If the Corporation shall, while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue Common Stock as a dividend or distributions to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock (other than pursuant to the Corporation\u2019s existing dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan or any future dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan the Corporation adopts which is not materially adverse to the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and in any case which is without duplication subject to an adjustment under Section 7(e)), then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction:   \n\n\n9   \n\n\n  (i)                 the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date and (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and   (ii)              the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date.   An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 7(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. \u201cRecord Date\u201d means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).   (b)               If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, subdivide, combine reclassify, or split its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction:   (i)                 the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective; and   (ii)              the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\non the day that such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective.   An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification, split or combination becomes effective.   (c)               If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights or warrants for a period expiring within 60 days to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock), at a price per share of Common Stock (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of Common Stock) less than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the announcement by public notice of such issuance or distribution (treating the conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of Common Stock of the securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of or exchange or exercise for such security into Common Stock divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction:   \n\n\n10   \n\n\n  (i)                 the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, and (y) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities; and   (ii)              the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date of announcement, and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate exercise price or conversion price payable to exercise or convert such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities divided by the average of the daily Closing Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date (subject to any adjustment as required pursuant to Section 7(g)) (\u201cCurrent Market Price\u201d) immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities.   An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(c) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such issuance. If the shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities upon the expiration or termination of such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, warrants, options, other securities, or convertible securities have been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued (or the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of such other securities). In determining whether any rights, warrants options, other securities, or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Closing Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, warrants options, other securities, or convertible securities, the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.   (d)               (i) If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all of the holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and the shares of Common Stock are not changed or exchanged), shares of its capital stock, evidences of the Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, or other assets or property, including securities, (including capital stock of any subsidiary of the Corporation) but excluding (i) dividends or distributions of Common Stock referred to in Section 7(a), (ii) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 7(c), (iii) dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section 7(e) and (iv) dividends and distributions of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) in connection with the reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 7 applies (such capital stock, evidence of its indebtedness, other assets or property or securities being distributed hereinafter in this Section 7(d) called the \u201cDistributed Assets\u201d), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:   \n\n\n11   \n\n\n  (A)             the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price; and   (B)              the denominator of which shall be (x) such Current Market Price, less (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) on such date of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed with respect to each share of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date for such distribution. \u201cFair Market Value \u201d means the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm\u2019s length transaction (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be made in good faith and, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding on holders of the Series C Preferred Stock).   An adjustment made pursuant to Section 7(d)(i) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.   (ii)              If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 7(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the \u201cReference Period\u201d) used in computing the Current Market Price pursuant to this Section 7(d) to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock.   (iii)            If any such distribution consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries (a \u201cSpin Off\u201d), the Fair Market Value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the Closing Sale Prices of such securities for the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the first Trading Day of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin Off, and the Current Market Price shall be measured for the same period. If, however, an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin Off occurs simultaneously with the Spin Off, Fair Market Value of the securities distributed in the Spin Off shall mean the initial public offering price of such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nsecurities and the Current Market Price shall mean the Closing Sale Price for the Common Stock on the same Trading Day.   \n\n\n12   \n\n\n  (iv)             Rights or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase equity securities of the Corporation (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (\u201cTrigger Event \u201d), (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (y) are not exercisable and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 7(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(d) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event. If such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different Distributed Assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a different number or amount of the foregoing Distributed Assets or to purchase any of the foregoing Distributed Assets at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance and Record Date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(d):   (A)             in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share repurchase price received by a holder of shares Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such repurchase; and   (B)              in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued.   (v)               For purposes of this Section 7(d) and Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 7(d) is applicable that also includes (x) shares of Common Stock, (y) a subdivision, split or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section 7(b) applies or (z) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 7(c) applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead to be:   (A)             a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants to which Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) apply, respectively (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 7(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by   \n\n\n13   \n\n\n    (B)              a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision, split or combination or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate increase required by Section 7(a), Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except:   (I)       the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (i) \u201cthe date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution,\u201d \u201cRecord Date fixed for such determinations\u201d and \u201cRecord Date\u201d within the meaning of Section 7(a), (ii) \u201cthe day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective\u201d or \u201cthe day upon which such combination becomes effective\u201d (as applicable) within the meaning of Section 7(b), and (iii) as \u201cthe Record Date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants\u201d and such \u201cRecord Date\u201d within the meaning of Section 7(c); and   (II)       any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision, split or combination (as applicable) shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution.   (e)               If the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period, cash (including any quarterly cash dividends, but excluding any cash that is distributed upon a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 8 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in Section 7(d)) which results in an annualized Common Stock dividend yield which is greater than 6.25% (the \u201cDividend Threshold Amount\u201d), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:   (i) CR1 = CRo +(($25.00 x (CSY \u2014 6.25%)/4)/SP) where,   (A)             CRo = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution;   (B)              CR1 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date for such distribution;   (C)              SP = the average of the Closing Sale price per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period prior to the Trading Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Record Date or the ex-dividend date of such cash excess dividend or cash excess distribution; and   \n\n\n14   \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(D)             CSY = the annualized Common Stock dividend yield, calculated as all cash dividends and cash distributions paid to the Corporation\u2019s holders of Common Stock during the fiscal quarter, multiplied by four, divided by SP.   Such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.   (f)                (i) If any tender offer made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of Common Stock shall expire, then, if the tender offer shall require the payment to the holders of Common Stock of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that exceeds the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the \u201cExpiration Date\u201d) tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) (the last time at which such tenders could have been made on the Expiration Date is hereinafter sometimes called the \u201cExpiration Time\u201d), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date by a fraction:   (A)             the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to holder of the Common Stock based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the \u201cPurchased Shares\u201d) and (y) the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares and excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the Expiration Time and (ii) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date; and   (B)              the denominator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including Purchased Shares but excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Corporation) at the Expiration Time multiplied by (y) the Current Market Price on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date.   (ii)              An adjustment pursuant to Section 7(f)(i) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Date.   (iii)            If the Corporation is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Corporation is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all such purchases or any or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would have been in effect based upon the number of shares actually purchased, if any. If the application of this Section 7(f) to any tender offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 7(f).   \n\n\n15   \n\n\n  (iv)             For purposes of this Section 7, the term \u201ctender offer\u201d shall mean and include both tender offers and exchange offers, all references to \u201cpurchases\u201d of shares in tender offers (and all similar references) shall mean and include both the purchase of shares in tender offers and the acquisition of shares pursuant to exchange offers, and all references to \u201ctendered shares\u201d (and all similar references) shall mean and include shares tendered in both tender offers and exchange offers.   (g)               Notwithstanding the foregoing and to the extent permitted by law, whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to this Section 7, such adjustments shall be made as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Section 7 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.   (h)               The Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 7(a), Section 7(b), Section 7(c), Section 7(d), Section 7(e) or Section 7(f), if the Board of Directors determines that it is advisable, in order that any dividend or distribution of Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above, or any event treated as such for United States federal income tax purposes, shall not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock for United States federal income tax purposes or to diminish any such tax. The Corporation shall give holders of Series C Preferred Stock at least 15 Trading Days\u2019 notice of any increase in the Conversion Rate.   (i)                 To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation may, from time to time, increase the Conversion Rate for a period of at least 20 Trading Days if the Board of Directors determines that such an increase would be in the Corporation\u2019s best interests. Any such determination by Board of Directors shall be conclusive. The Corporation shall give holders of Series C Preferred Stock at least 15 Trading Days\u2019 notice of any increase in the Conversion Rate.   (j)                 The Corporation shall not adjust the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 7 to the extent that the adjustments would reduce the Conversion Price below $0.0001. The Corporation shall not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least one percent in the Conversion Rate. However, any adjustments that are not required to be made because they would have required an increase or decrease of less than one percent shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment of the Conversion Rate. Except as described in this Section 7, the Corporation shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for any issuance of shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for its shares of Common Stock or rights to purchase its shares of Common Stock or such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities.   (k)               In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7, the holder of any Series C Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock into which the Series C Preferred Stock originally were convertible, the Conversion Rate of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Series C Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (1) of this Section 7, and any other applicable provisions of the Charter with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares.   \n\n\n16   \n\n\n  (l)                 To the extent the Corporation has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall receive (except to the extent the Corporation settles its conversion obligations in cash), in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan unless the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock prior to the time of conversion, in which case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation made a distribution referred to in Section 7(d) above (without regard to any of the exceptions therein).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(8)               Consolidation or Merger of the Corporation.   (a)               In the case of the following events (each, a \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d): (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock, other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of subdivision or a combination; (ii) a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange of the Corporation with another Person; (iii) a sale, conveyance or lease to another corporation of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; or (iv) a statutory share exchange; in each case, as a result of which holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, the Corporation or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall provide that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled thereafter to convert such Series C Preferred Stock into the Conversion Cash together with the kind and amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) which such holder of Series C Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive upon such Business Combination had such shares been converted into Conversion Cash and Common Stock immediately prior to such Business Combination. If holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such Business Combination, the Corporation will make adequate provision whereby the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the Series C Preferred Stock, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the effective date of such Business Combination. Such determination shall be based on the weighted average of elections made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock who participate in such determination, shall be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common Stock are subject, such as pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Business Combination, and shall be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earliest of (i) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock, and (ii) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Business Combination. The Corporation shall provide notice of the opportunity to determine the form of such consideration, as well as notice of the determination made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (and the weighted average of elections), by issuing a press release or providing other appropriate notice, and by providing a copy of such notice to the Board of Directors. If the effective date of the Business Combination is delayed beyond the initially anticipated effective date, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be given the opportunity to make subsequent similar determinations in regard to such delayed effective date. The documents governing the rights of such securities shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and other appropriate numerical thresholds which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Rate provided for in Section 7. If, in the case of any such Business Combination, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of shares of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Business Combination, then such documents governing the rights of such securities shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Section 12(a) hereof.   \n\n\n17   \n\n\n  (b)               The Corporation shall cause notice of the execution of such documents governing the rights of such securities to be mailed to each holder of Series C Preferred Stock, at the address of such holder as it appears on the Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such documents governing the rights of such securities.   (c)               The above provisions of this Section 8 shall similarly apply to successive Business Combinations.   (d)               The Corporation shall not become a party to any Business Combination unless its terms are consistent in all material respects with the provisions of this Section 8.   (e)               None of the provisions of this Section 8 shall affect the right of a Series C Preferred Stockholder to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock prior to the effective date of a Business Combination.   (f)                If this Section 8 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 7 hereof shall not apply.   (9)               Notice of Adjustment. Whenever an adjustment in the Conversion Rate with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock is required:   (a)               the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer (or such person having similar responsibilities of the Corporation), stating the adjusted Conversion Rate determined as provided herein and setting forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment; and   (b)               a Notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall forthwith be given by the Corporation to each holder of Series C Preferred Stock. Any Notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such Notice.   (10)           Notice in Certain Events. In case of:   (a)               a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party and for which approval of any holders of Common Stock of the Corporation is required, or of the sale or conveyance to another person or entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; or   \n\n\n18   \n\n\n  (b)               the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; or   (c)               any action triggering an adjustment of the Conversion Rate referred to in clauses (x) or (y) below; then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be given, to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a Notice stating:   (x)       the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of any distribution or grant of rights or warrants triggering an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7 hereof, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record of Common Stock entitled to such distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined; or   (y)       the date on which any reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up triggering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nan adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10 hereof is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.   Failure to give such Notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in Section 10(a), Section 10(b) or Section 10(c).   (11)           Purchase of Series C Preferred Stock upon a Fundamental Change.   (a)               In the event of a fundamental change, a holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right to require the Corporation to purchase (the \u201cRepurchase Right\u201d) for cash all or any part of such holder\u2019s shares of Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price (the \u201cFundamental Change Repurchase Price\u201d) equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of the Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid dividends (including additional dividends, if any) to, but not including, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined below). Shares of Series C Preferred Stock submitted for purchase must be $25.00 liquidation preference or an integral multiple thereof.   (b)               Within 30 calendar days after the occurrence of a fundamental change, the Corporation shall provide to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and the transfer agent a Notice of the occurrence of the fundamental change and of the resulting Repurchase Right. Such Notice shall state:   (i)                the events constituting the fundamental change;   (ii)              the date of the fundamental change;   \n\n\n19   \n\n\n  (iii)            the last date on which a holder may exercise the Repurchase Right;   (iv)             the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price;   (v)              the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;   (vi)             the name and address of the transfer agent;   (vii)           that Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which a repurchase notice is given by the holder may be converted, if otherwise convertible, only if the repurchase notice has been properly withdrawn; and   (viii)           the procedures that a holder must follow to exercise the Repurchase Right.   (c)               Simultaneously with providing such Notice, the Corporation shall publish a notice containing this information in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York or through such other public medium as the Corporation may use at that time and publish such information on its corporate website.   (d)               To exercise the Repurchase Right, subject to Section 11(e), a holder of the Series C Preferred Stock must deliver, on or before the twentieth Trading Day after the date of the Corporation\u2019s delivery of Notice of a fundamental change (subject to extension to comply with applicable law), the Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased, duly endorsed for transfer, together with a written repurchase notice and the form entitled \u201cForm of Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice\u201d duly completed to the transfer agent. The repurchase notice must state:   (i)               the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;   (ii)              the portion of the liquidation preference of Series C Preferred Stock to be purchased, in integral multiples of $25.00; and   (iii)             that the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be purchased by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11.   (e)               If the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not in certificated form, a holder\u2019s repurchase notice must comply with applicable DTC procedures.   (f)                A holder of Series C Preferred Stock may withdraw any repurchase notice (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the Trading Day prior to the Repurchase Date. The notice of withdrawal shall state:   (i)                 the liquidation preference of the withdrawn Series C Preferred Stock, in integral multiples of $25.00;   (ii)              if certificated shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn Series C Preferred Stock; and   \n\n\n20   \n\n\n  (iii)            the liquidation preference, if any, which remains subject to the repurchase notice.   (g)               If the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not in certificated form, a holder\u2019s notice of withdrawal must comply with applicable DTC procedures.   (h)               The Corporation shall be required to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock no less than 30 days nor more than 45 days after the date of the Corporation\u2019s delivery of Notice of the fundamental change, subject to extension to comply with applicable law (as set forth in the Notice of the fundamental change, the \u201cFundamental Change Repurchase Date\u201d). A holder of Series C Preferred Stock shall receive payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Series C Preferred Stock.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(i)                 If the transfer agent holds cash sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of the Series C Preferred Stock on the Trading Day following the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, then:   (i)                 the Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding and dividends (including additional dividends, if any) shall cease to accrue (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Series C Preferred Stock is made or whether or not the Series C Preferred Stock certificate, if applicable, is delivered to the transfer agent); and   (ii)              all other rights of the holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price upon delivery or transfer of the Series C Preferred Stock).   (j)                 In connection with a fundamental change repurchase, the Corporation shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws in connection with any offer by the Corporation to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change.   (k)               The Corporation shall not be required to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change if a third party (1) makes an offer to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to the Corporation to repurchase Series C Preferred Stock upon a fundamental change and (2) purchases all of the Series C Preferred Stock validly delivered and not withdrawn under such offer to purchase Series C Preferred Stock.   (l)                 A \u201cfundamental change\u201d shall be deemed to occur upon a change of control or a termination of trading.   (m)             A \u201cchange of control\u201d shall be deemed to have occurred at such time, after the Effective Time of the merger of Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, when the following has occurred:   (i)                 any \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) acquires the beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of 50% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation\u2019s total outstanding voting stock other than an acquisition by the Corporation or any of subsidiaries of the Corporation;   \n\n\n21   \n\n\n  (ii)              the Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into, another person or conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of the Corporation assets to any person, or any person consolidates with or merges with or into the Corporation, other than: (1) any transaction (A) that does not result in any reclassification, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of the Corporation\u2019s capital stock and (B) pursuant to which the Corporation\u2019s capital stockholders immediately prior to the transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Corporation\u2019s capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction; or (2) any merger solely for the purpose of changing the Corporation\u2019s jurisdiction of formation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of common stock solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity; or   (iii)            the Corporation approves a plan of liquidation or dissolution.   (n)               A \u201ctermination of trading\u201d is deemed to occur if the Common Stock (or other common stock into which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are then convertible) is neither listed for trading on a United States national securities exchange nor approved for trading on an established automated over- the-counter trading market in the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a change of control if 100% of the consideration for the Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters\u2019 appraisal rights) in the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control consists of common stock traded on a United States National securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Global Market and Nasdaq Capital Market), or which shall be so traded when issued or exchanged in connection with the change of control, and as a result of such transaction or transactions the shares of Series C Preferred Stock become convertible solely into such common stock.   (12)           Voting Rights.   (a)               Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as set forth below.   (b)               Whenever dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) (a \u201cPreferred Dividend Default\u201d), the holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock, upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the \u201cPreferred Stock Directors\u201d), and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall increase by two, at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at least 10% of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders of any other series of Parity Stock so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment.   \n\n\n22   \n\n\n  (c)               If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series C Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) hereof (subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall decrease by two. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) (voting separately as a class with the Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable). So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 12(b) (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (d)               So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class, together with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of any event set forth in (ii) above, so long as the Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock and; provided, further, that any increase in the amount of the authorized preferred stock, including the Series C Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional Series C Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.   \n\n\n23   \n\n\n  (13)           Restrictions on Transfer.  The Series C Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series C Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series C Preferred Stock. In addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series C Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:   \u201cThe Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the Corporation or to its transfer agent.\u201d   (14)           Settlement. Nothing in this Article Second of these Articles Supplementary shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange or other securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or an automated inter-dealer quotation system.   THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law.   FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles Supplementary for record.   \n\n\n24   \n\n\n  I N WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer and witnessed by its Secretary on [__________], 2021.   WITNESS:  READY CAPITAL CORPORATION         By:            By:                Andrew Ahlborn, Secretary  Thomas E. Capasse, Chief Executive Officer   THE UNDERSIGNED, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, who executed on behalf of the Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary of which this Certificate is made a part, hereby acknowledges in the name and on behalf of said Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of said Corporation and hereby certifies that the matters and facts set forth herein with respect to the authorization and approval thereof are true in all material respects under the penalties of perjury.     By:             Thomas E. Capasse, Chief Executive Officer   \n\n\n25   \n\n\n    ANNEX D   READY CAPITAL CORPORATION   ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY ESTABLISHING AND FIXING THE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF A SERIES OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK   READY CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (hereinafter called the \u201c Corporation\u201d), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n FIRST: Under a power contained in Section 2-208 of the Maryland General Corporation Law and Article VI of the Corporation\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), by resolutions duly adopted, classified and designated 2,010,278 shares of the unissued preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Corporation (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), as 7.625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and has provided for the issuance of such series. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter.   SECOND: The terms of the Preferred Stock as set by the Board and the pricing committee thereof, including preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption, are as follows:   (1)               Designation and Number.  A series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, designated as \u201c7.625% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\u201d (the \u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d), is hereby established. The par value of the Series D Preferred Stock is $0.0001 per share. The number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be 2,010,278.   (2)               Rank. The Series D Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, rank (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock of the Corporation and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank junior to such Series D Preferred Stock; (b) on parity with the Parity Stock (as defined below); and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation the terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities rank senior to the Series D Preferred Stock. The term \u201cequity securities\u201d shall not include convertible debt securities. The term \u201cParity Stock\u201d means all classes and series of preferred stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock, including the Corporation\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, with respect to the payments of distributions and rights to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.   (3)               Dividends.   (a)                Holders of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 7.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.90625 per share). Such dividends shall be cumulative from [ \u2022 ], 20211 and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day (each, a \u201cDividend Payment Date\u201d). Any dividend payable on the Series D Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of each of March, June, September and December, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (each, a \u201cDividend Record Date\u201d).   \n\n\n    \n\n\n  (b)                No dividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be declared by the Corporation or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibit such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provide that such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.   (c)                Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not the terms and provisions set forth in Section 3(b) hereof at any time prohibit the current payment of dividends, whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable.   (d)               Except as provided in Section 3(e) hereof, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than dividends in shares of Common Stock or dividends in shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or any Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation and except for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Charter).   (e)                When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series D Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Parity Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on Series D Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.     \n\n\n1 To be the last dividend payment date before the Effective Time of the Merger (provided that if such Effective Time occurs after the dividend record date for a dividend and before the dividend payment date for such dividend, such date shall be the dividend payment date for such dividend).   \n\n\n2   \n\n\n  (f)                Any dividend payment made on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property or stock in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock as described above.   (4)               Liquidation Preference.   (a)                Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation, legally available for distribution to its stockholders, a liquidation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\npreference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) to the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation that ranks junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights.   (b)               In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of Parity Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock and stockholders of such classes or series of Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.   (c)               After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.   (d)               Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series D Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.   (e)               The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or entity or of any other corporation with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.   \n\n\n3   \n\n\n  (5)               Redemption.   (a)               Optional Redemption Right. The Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\u2019 written notice, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If the Corporation elects to redeem any shares of Series D Preferred Stock as described in this Section 5(a), it may use any available cash to pay the redemption price, and it will not be required to pay the redemption price only out of the proceeds from the issuance of other equity securities or any other specific source.   (b)               Special Optional Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\u2019 written notice, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as defined below) with respect to the shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption. If the Corporation elects to redeem any shares of Series D Preferred Stock as described in this Section 5(b), it may use any available cash to pay the redemption price, and it will not be required to pay the redemption price only out of the proceeds from the issuance of other equity securities or any other specific source.   (c)               A \u201cChange of Control\u201d is deemed to occur when, after the effective time of the merger of Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a Maryland corporation, with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, the following have occurred and are continuing:   (i)                 (A) any \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) acquires the beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of 50% or more of the total voting power of the total outstanding voting stock of the Corporation other than an acquisition by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;   (B)       the Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into, another person or conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to any person, or any person consolidates with or merges with or into the Corporation, other than: (x) any transaction (1) that does not result in any reclassification, exchange, or cancellation of outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation, and (2) pursuant to which the Corporation\u2019s capital stockholders immediately prior to the transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction; or (y) any merger solely for the purpose of changing the Corporation\u2019s jurisdiction of formation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of common stock solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity; or   \n\n\n4   \n\n\n  (C)       the Corporation approves a plan of liquidation or dissolution; and   (ii)              following the closing of any transaction referred to in clause (i) above, neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities listed for trading on a United States national securities exchange (including the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d)).   (d)               In the event the Corporation elects to redeem Series D Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption at such holder\u2019s address as it appears on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the procedure for surrendering shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant to Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) hereof; (vii) if applicable, that such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to tender such shares of Series D Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control, and that each share of Series D Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If less than all of the Series D Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nthe number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Any such redemption may be made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board and as set forth in the notice of redemption.   (e)                Holders of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall follow the procedures for surrendering the Series D Preferred Stock set forth in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends payable upon the redemption following the surrender.   (f)                 If notice of redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock has been given and if the Corporation irrevocably sets aside the funds necessary for redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the payment of the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any), dividends will cease to accrue on those shares of Series D Preferred Stock, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding, and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.   \n\n\n5   \n\n\n  (g)                If any redemption date is not a business day, then the redemption price and accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be paid on the next business day and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount payable for the period from and after that redemption date to that next business day.   (h)                If less than all of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares).   (i)                 Immediately prior to any redemption of Series D Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case each holder of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares o n the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this Section 6(i), the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed.   (j)                 Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series D Preferred Stock (except by exchanging it for its capital stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Corporation of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to preserve its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock.   (k)                Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase shares of Series D Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement. Any shares of Series D Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever may be retired and re- classified as authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued by us as any class or series of Preferred Stock.   (6)               Conversion Rights. Shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Corporation, except as provided in this Section 6.   \n\n\n6   \n\n\n  (a)                Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 5 hereof, in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to any shares of Series D Preferred Stock that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder (the \u201cChange of Control Conversion Right\u201d) on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of Series D Preferred Stock (the \u201cCommon Stock Conversion Consideration\u201d) equal to the lesser of:   (i)               the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series D Preferred Stock plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the Series D Preferred Stock, in which case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (B) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and   (ii)              [______]2 (the \u201cShare Cap\u201d), subject to adjustments provided in Section 6(b) hereof.   (b)               The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Stock to existing holders of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a \u201cShare Split\u201d) with respect to Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will not exceed the Share Cap multiplied by the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the \u201cExchange Cap\u201d). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap.     \n\n\n2 Amount equal to the product of the (i) Share Cap applicable to the Anworth Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (ii) a fraction in which (x) the numerator is equal to the sum of (A) the final Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger and (B) the product of (I) the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nExchange Ratio in the Merger and (II) the average of the Corporation\u2019s closing sales prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding but not including the date on which the effective time of the Merger occurs and (y) the denominator is the average of the Corporation\u2019s closing sales prices per share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding but not including the date on which the effective time of the Merger occurs.   \n\n\n7   \n\n\n  (c)               The \u201cChange of Control Conversion Date\u201d is the date the Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a business day selected by the Corporation that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which it provides the notice described in Section 6(h) hereof to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock.   (d)               The \u201cCommon Stock Price\u201d is (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock, or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock is other than solely cash, (A) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal United States national securities exchange on which Common Stock is then traded, or (B) the average of the last quoted bid prices for Common Stock in the over-the- counter market as reported by Pink OTC Markets Inc. or another similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if Common Stock is not then listed for trading on a United States national securities exchange.   (e)                In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock is or will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the \u201cAlternative Form Consideration\u201d), a holder of Series D Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the \u201cAlternative Conversion Consideration\u201d; the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a Change of Control, is referred to as the \u201cConversion Consideration\u201d).   (f)                If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election if electing between two types of consideration, or holders of a plurality of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an election if electing between more than two types of consideration, as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Change of Control.   (g)               No fractional shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be issued. Instead, the Corporation will make, and the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, a cash payment equal to the value of such fractional shares based upon the Common Stock Price used in determining the Common Stock Conversion Consideration for such Change of Control.   \n\n\n8   \n\n\n  (h)               Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, provided that the Corporation has not then exercised its right to redeem all shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the Corporation will provide to holders of Series D Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, which notice shall be delivered to the holders of record of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock in their addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem any or all shares of Series D Preferred Stock, holders will not be able to convert such shares of Series D Preferred Stock called for redemption and such shares will be redeemed on the applicable redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series D Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent, transfer agent and conversion agent for the Series D Preferred Stock; (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series D Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right (including procedures for surrendering shares for conversion through the facilities of DTC (as defined below)), including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such holders as described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal.   (i)                 The Corporation shall also issue a press release containing such notice provided for in Section 6(h) hereof for publication on Dow Jones & Company, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), and post a notice on its website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first business day following any date on which it provides the notice provided for in Section 6(h) hereof to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock.   (j)                 To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of DTC, together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by the Corporation, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the Series D Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock.   (k)                Holders of Series D Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of the Corporation prior to the close of business on the business day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by any holder must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series D Preferred Stock; and (ii) the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the holder\u2019s conversion notice.   \n\n\n9  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (l)                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 6(j) and (k) hereof, the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d).   (m)               Series D Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, in which case only the shares of Series D Preferred Stock properly surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not called for redemption, if any, will be converted as aforesaid. If the Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series D Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date the redemption price as provided in Section 5 hereof.   (n)               The Corporation shall deliver all securities, cash (including, without limitation, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered on conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control Conversion Date.   (o)               In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Corporation shall comply with all federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or other property. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series D Preferred Stock, no holder of Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such Series D Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of such Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the applicable share ownership limitations contained in the Charter or these Articles Supplementary, unless the Corporation provides an exemption from this limitation to such holder pursuant to the Charter and these Articles Supplementary.   (p)                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in this Section 6(p), the Corporation will make no allowance for unpaid dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted.   \n\n\n10   \n\n\n  (7)               Voting Rights.   (a)                Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as set forth below.   (b)               Whenever dividends on any shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) (a \u201cPreferred Dividend Default\u201d), the holders of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock, upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the \u201cPreferred Stock Directors\u201d), and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall increase by two, at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at least 10% of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders of any other series of Parity Stock so in arrears (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series D Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment.   (c)                If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series D Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 13(b) hereof (subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the current dividend period have been paid in full or set aside for payment in full on all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall decrease by two. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 13(b) hereof (voting separately as a class with the Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) so long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights set forth in Section 13(b) hereof (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) the Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.   (d)               So long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class, together with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock of the Corporation into any such shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of any event set forth in (ii) above, so long as the Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock and; provided, further, that any increase in the amount of the authorized preferred stock, including the Series D Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional Series D Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of such series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.   \n\n\n11  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n (e)                Further to Section 7(d)(ii) hereof, if any amendment, alteration or repeal of the provisions of the Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock or the holders thereof but not all series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, shall be required in addition to the vote or consent that would otherwise be required by Section 7(d)(ii) hereof.   (8)               Restrictions on Transfer.  The Series D Preferred Stock is governed by and issued subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of the Charter, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter; provided, however, that the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article VII of the Charter shall also be applied to the Series D Preferred Stock separately and without regard to any other series or class he foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability of any other term or provision of the Charter to the Series D Preferred Stock in addition to the legend contemplated by Article VII, Section 7.2.9 of the Charter, each certificate for Series D Preferred Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:   \u201cThe Corporation will furnish to any stockholder on request and without charge a full statement of the designations and any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the stock of each class which the Corporation is authorized to issue, to the extent they have been set, and of the authority of the Board of Directors to set the relative rights and preferences of a subsequent series of a preferred or special class of stock. Such request may be made to the Secretary of the Corporation or to its transfer agent.\u201d   (9)               Settlement. Nothing in this Second Article of these Articles Supplementary shall be interpreted to preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or other securities exchange (including Nasdaq), or an automated inter-dealer quotation system.   \n\n\n12   \n\n\n  THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law.   FOURTH: These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these Articles Supplementary for record.   * * * * * * * *   \n\n\n13   \n\n\n  I N WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles Supplementary to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer, and witnessed by its Secretary on [_________], 2021.   WITNESS:  READY CAPITAL CORPORATION     By:              By:                    Andrew Ahlborn, Secretary  Thomas E. Capasse, Chief Executive Officer   THE UNDERSIGNED, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, who executed on behalf of the Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary of which this Certificate is made a part, hereby acknowledges in the name and on behalf of said Corporation the foregoing Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of said Corporation and hereby certifies that the matters and facts set forth herein with respect to the authorization and approval thereof are true in all material respects under the penalties of perjury.     By:            Thomas E. Capasse, Chief Executive Officer   \n\n\n14   \n\n\n    EXHIBIT A   Form of First Amendment to Management Agreement   THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this \u201cAmendment\u201d) is made and entered into as of December 6, 2020 by and among Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), Anworth Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cManager\u201d), and, solely for the purposes of Section 6 hereof, Ready Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (\u201cParent\u201d). The Company, the Manager and Parent are each sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cParty\u201d, and collectively as, the \u201cParties\u201d. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Management Agreement or the Merger Agreement (each as defined below), as the case may be.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Company and the Manager are parties to that certain Management Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2011 (the \u201cManagement Agreement\u201d);   WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the entry into this Amendment, the Company has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 6, 2020, by and among Parent, RC Merger Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and the Company (as may be amended from time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which it is contemplated that the Company will merge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nwith and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving entity of the merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d); and   WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, the Parties desire, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to amend the Management Agreement to provide, among other things, for: (i) the termination of the Management Agreement effective as of the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (ii) certain additional obligations and agreements among the Parties and for the benefit of Parent.   AGREEMENT   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:   1.             Termination of Management Agreement; Survival of Certain Provisions.   (a)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Management Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that the Management Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Company and the Manager thereunder (including, without limitation, Section 3(b) thereof) shall be automatically terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Closing Date (such termination, the \u201cTermination\u201d, which shall be deemed a Termination Without Cause (as defined in the Management Agreement)), without any further notice or action by any of the Company or the Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing:   (i)           The Manager shall be entitled to receive the monthly Management Fee payable to the Manager pursuant to the terms and conditions of Management Agreement, prorated through the date of the Termination. Within 15 days following the Closing Date, the Manager will deliver to Parent, as successor to the Company, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Manager\u2019s good faith computation, in accordance with the Management Agreement and consistent with past practice, of any and all Management Fees accrued pursuant to Section 6 of the Management Agreement and unpaid as of the Closing Date (the \u201cAccrued Management Fee\u201d); provided, however, that (A) the Accrued Management Fee for the month in which the Closing occurs shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in such month that have elapsed up to and including the Closing Date compared to the total number of days in such month, and (B) for purposes of the computation of the Accrued Management Fee for the month in which the Closing occurs, Equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) shall be determined as of the end of the month which occurred immediately prior to the Closing Date. Within five (5) Business Days following the Manager\u2019s delivery of such written statement of the Accrued Management Fees pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent or Merger Sub, as successor to the Company, will pay to the Manager the Accrued Management Fees.   \n\n\n1   \n\n\n  (ii)          Within 15 days following the Closing Date, the Manager will deliver to Parent, as successor to the Company, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of all unreimbursed expenses (A) incurred by the Manager or its Affiliates on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice prior to the Closing Date, which are reimbursable to the Manager or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of Section 7 of the Management Agreement, and (B) that have been incurred by the Manager in connection with the Termination, including, without limitation, third-party legal, expert and other fees and expenses relating to any actions, proceedings, lawsuits, demands, causes of action and claims, whether actual or threatened, made by or against the Company in connection with, or after public announcement of, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions (collectively, the \u201c Unreimbursed Expenses\u201d). Within five (5) Business Days following the Manager\u2019s delivery of such written statement of the Unreimbursed Expenses pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent or Merger Sub, as successor to the Company, will pay to the Manager the Unreimbursed Expenses.   (iii)         Promptly following the Closing Date, the Manager shall take those actions required of the Manager pursuant to Section 13 of the Management Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; provided, that for such purposes all payments shall be made, and all documents and property delivered, to the Parent as successor to the Company.   (iv)         The following provisions of the Management Agreement shall survive the Termination and shall continue to remain in full force and effect: Section 5 (Records; Confidentiality), Section 7 (Expenses of the Company), solely to the extent of any Unreimbursed Expenses, Section 8 (Limits of the Manager\u2019s Responsibility), Section 13 (Action Upon Termination), and Section 14 (Release of Money or Other Property Upon Written Request).   (b)           Prior to the Termination, (i) the Company and the Manager shall comply in all respects with all the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement, (ii) the Company and the Manager shall not amend the Management Agreement or this Amendment, in each case without the prior written consent of Parent, and (iii) except as specifically permitted or required by the Merger Agreement, as required by law, or as consented to in writing by Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Manager shall conduct its activities with respect to the Company and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, and its obligations pursuant to the Management Agreement, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material respects. Further, the Manager agrees to cooperate with the Company and Parent prior to the Closing and take all actions reasonably requested by the Company or Parent prior to the Closing in order to carry out and effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.   2.             Termination Payment.   (a)           In consideration for the Termination and the other promises, undertakings and releases of the Manager hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Manager the termination fee amount of $20,300,000 (the \u201cTermination Payment\u201d), payable in a lump sum cash payment on the Closing Date, subject to the Manager\u2019s compliance with the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as amended by this Amendment). The Termination Payment shall be deemed (i) to constitute, and shall in all respects satisfy all obligations with respect to, the \u201cTermination Fee\u201d (as defined by the Management Agreement), and (ii) to be the aggregate unpaid Management Fee that, had the Management Agreement not been automatically terminated as of the Closing, would have accrued under Section 6 of the Management Agreement for the period commencing on the day immediately following the Closing Date and the Termination through the end of the Automatic Renewal Term (as defined in the Management Agreement) ended December 31, 2021.   \n\n\n2   \n\n\n  (b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Management Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Termination Payment, any Accrued Management Fee, and any Unreimbursed Expenses payable hereunder, shall be the entire amounts payable to the Manager or any of its affiliates in connection with the Termination and thereafter under or in respect of the Management Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Merger Agreement without the occurrence of the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nAgreement), and except with respect to those rights and obligations which, pursuant to Section 1 hereof, survive the Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Termination, the Manager shall only be entitled to receive payments from the Company that are consistent with past practice and pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement; provided, that this Section 2(b) shall not be deemed to limit any bona fide claims the Manager may have (and any payments related thereto) pursuant to Section 7 (to the extent of any Unreimbursed Expenses to be reimbursed after the Closing), Section 8, Section 13, or Section 14 of the Management Agreement.   3.             Waiver of Notice Requirement . Each of the Company and the Manager hereby (i) agree that this Amendment constitutes all required notice of termination of the Management Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, and (ii) waives, whether exercisable now or at any time in the future, any and all rights to notice under the Management Agreement, to the extent relating to the transactions contemplated by this Amendment or the Merger Agreement.   4.             Release.   (a)           Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Termination, each of the Company, the Manager, and its respective affiliates hereby fully and unconditionally releases and forever discharges the other party and the affiliates of the other party (including, as applicable, the Company\u2019s Subsidiaries, Parent, the affiliates of Parent, and the Surviving Company), and their respective administrators, executors, representatives, successors and assigns, from any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts, accounts, covenants, liabilities, disputes, agreements, promises, damages, judgments, executions, claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity (\u201cClaims\u201d) that they ever had, now have, or that they or their administrators, executors, representatives, successors and assigns hereafter can or may have, arising under or pursuant to the Management Agreement, except with respect to those rights and obligations which, pursuant to Section 1 hereof, survive the Termination.   (b)           Each of the Company and the Manager agrees that it shall not make any assignment of any Claim or any right of any kind whatsoever embodied in any of the Claims released herein, and that no other person or entity of any kind shall have any interest in any of the Claims released herein.   5.            Certain Reduction of Payments by the Company. If, notwithstanding such agreement and understanding of the parties, it is ultimately established, pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved (in any such case, a \u201cFinal Determination\u201d), that some portion of the Termination Payment paid pursuant to Section 2 hereof constitutes an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), then the Manager and/or any of its service providers that are deemed to be disqualified individuals who received excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code (each, a \u201cRecipient\u201d) shall be obligated to pay back to the Parent, as successor to the Company, or, if such Recipient is or was a service provider to the Manager, such Recipient shall be obligated to pay back to the Manager who shall, in turn, be obligated to pay such amounts received to Parent, as successor to the Company, a portion of such payments equal to the Repayment Amount within 30 days of such Final Determination. The \u201cRepayment Amount\u201d shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be repaid to the Parent, as successor to the Company, so that such Recipient\u2019s net after-tax proceeds (after taking into account the payment of the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code (the \u201cExcise Tax\u201d) and all other taxes imposed on the Termination Payment) shall be maximized, and shall include interest at the applicable Federal rate, as determined under Section 1274 of the Code. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 5, such Recipient shall pay the applicable Excise Tax. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Manager, the Recipients, the Company, and Parent, as successor to the Company, agree to work together and use commercially reasonable efforts to address any potential effects of Section 280G of the Code, including, without limitation (and in the Manager\u2019s discretion), engaging a third-party valuation expert to help demonstrate that any payments made or to be made to a Recipient should be considered \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.   \n\n\n3   \n\n\n  6.             Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries; Guarantee; Further Actions; Specific Performance; Representations and Warranties.   (a)           This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns as provided in this Amendment. Parent and its affiliates, successors and assigns shall be entitled to rely on this Amendment in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Parent shall be an express third-party beneficiary of this Amendment (including applicable provisions of the Management Agreement), and Parent shall be entitled to enforce any such provisions.   (b)           Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the timely and full performance of the obligations of the Company that by their terms survive the Closing and the Termination under this Amendment and the Management Agreement as if it were the Company. Parent waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to this Section 6(b), its guaranteed obligations, and all demands whatsoever. Parent covenants that the guarantee in this Section 6(b) will not be discharged, except by complete performance of the obligations contained in this Amendment, subject in all cases to the terms of this Amendment.   (c)           Each Party agrees to execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments and to perform such additional acts as any Party may reasonably request or as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to effectuate, consummate and perform the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Amendment.   (d)          It is understood and agreed that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Amendment by any Party and that any non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such actual or potential breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by a Party of this Amendment, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to any non-breaching Party.   (e)           Each of the Parties hereby represents and warrants to the other Parties that (i) such Party has the absolute and unrestricted right, power, and authority to (A) execute and deliver this Amendment, and (B) perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) such Party has consulted with, or has been afforded the opportunity to consult with, counsel of its own choosing in connection with this Amendment and that it enters into this Amendment of its own free will and as its independent act.   7.            Termination. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger, this Amendment shall automatically terminate and be of no further effect (except as specifically set forth herein) and the Management Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.   \n\n\n4   \n\n\n  8.             Survival. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Parties contained in this Amendment which by the terms thereof contemplate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nperformance after the Closing and the Termination shall survive the Closing and the Termination.   9.             Severability. If any term or other provision of this Amendment is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Amendment shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Amendment shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Amendment so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this Amendment be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   10.           Entire Agreement; Amendment. The Management Agreement and this Amendment constitute the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Any amendment or modification to this Amendment shall be effective only if in writing and signed by each Party.   11.           Publicity. During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, none of the Company, the Manager, or their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this Amendment without the prior consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that the Company shall be allowed to disclose and file this Amendment in applicable filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   12.           Headings. All headings herein are inserted only for convenience and ease of reference and are not to be considered in the interpretation of any provision of this Amendment.   13.           Agreement Not to be Strictly Construed Against any Party. This Amendment shall be construed and interpreted as if each of the Parties drafted this Amendment concurrently. Any ambiguity or interpretation of this Amendment shall not be construed against any Party, and any such ambiguity or interpretation shall be determined as if each of the Parties drafted this Amendment concurrently.   14.           Counterparts; Electronic Signatures. This Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Amendment may be executed by facsimile, pdf scan, or other form of electronic signature.   15.           Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof.   16.           Payments. All payments to be made pursuant to Section 1 and Section 2 hereof shall be made by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to an account designated by the Manager in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to such payment.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: \n\n\n(a) Conversion of Company Shares. Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (A) any Dissenting Shares and (B) any Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), without interest and less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to Section 3.5. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2 or Section 3.4. \n\n\n(b) Merger Sub Equity Interests. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. \n\n\n(c) Cancelled Shares. Each Company Share that is owned directly by the Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \u201cCancelled Shares\u201d) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. \n\n\n3.2 Payment for Securities\u037e Surrender of Certificates. \n\n\n(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as depositary agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 1.1(e) and as the paying agent -11-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nfor the Company Stockholders entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or promptly after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to (i) the aggregate consideration to which the Company Stockholders are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.1(e) and (ii) the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (such cash amounts, collectively, the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d) for the sole benefit of the holders of Company Shares. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make delivery of the Offer Price and Merger Consideration, as applicable, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to pay the aggregate amounts contemplated by Section 1.1(e) and Section 3.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional cash in immediately available funds, as applicable, with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Company Shares\u037e provided that, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\u2019s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares. \n\n\n(b) Procedures for Surrender. \n\n\n(i) Payment of Offer Price. Following the Acceptance Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the Company Stockholders that are entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 1.1(e) such amount in respect thereof in accordance with the terms of Section 1.1(e) and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. \n\n\n(ii) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (the \u201cCertificates\u201d), which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall have a customary release of all claims against Parent, Merger Sub and the Company arising out of or related to such holder\u2019s ownership of Company Shares and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree upon (a \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCertificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing any Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or any Cancelled Shares. \n\n\n(iii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (\u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall upon the Effective Time, in accordance with The Depository Trust Company\u2019s customary procedures (including receipt by the Paying Agent of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d (or such other evidence of transfer or surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)) and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for returning such Letter of Transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of -13-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nsuch Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5), and such Book- Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Cancelled Shares. \n\n\n(c) Transfer Books\u037e No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2, or Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Cancelled Shares. The Merger Consideration paid to such Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or any other valid evidence of ownership of Company Shares that have not previously been surrendered are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. \n\n\n(d) Termination of Exchange Fund\u037e Abandoned Property\u037e No Liability. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, in each case without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder\u2019s surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b). Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the -14-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nPaying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. \n\n\n(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, in customary form, reasonably acceptable to Parent (which shall contain an agreement in customary form to indemnify Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificates) of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(a), without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. In addition, Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration require the owner(s) of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a customary and reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. \n\n\n3.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this Section 3.3), Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the \u201cDissenting Shares\u201d) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and shall be exchangeable for, subject to compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b), solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5 and as required by applicable Law. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand\u037e and (ii) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not pay or settle, or make any payment or settlement offer, prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument or agree to do any of the foregoing unless Parent shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement, or payment or settlement offer. -15-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n3.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. \n\n\n(a) Company Stock Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) an amount equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, less (B) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (the \u201cOption Consideration\u201d)\u037e provided, however, that any Company Stock Option with respect to which the applicable per share exercise price is greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without consideration therefor. Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a Company Stock Option, the applicable Option Consideration with respect to such Company Stock Option (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the Effective Time. \n\n\n(b) Company RSU Awards. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the \u201cRSU Consideration\u201d). Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a Company RSU Award who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was a non-employee director of the Company the applicable RSU Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the Effective Time (or, if applicable, the applicable Deferred Settlement Date). With respect to each Company RSU Award that as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was held by an individual who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was not a non-employee director of the Company, as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the earlier of (i) the nine-month anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) the date on which such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) was scheduled to vest in accordance with its terms as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such earlier date, the \u201cRSU Vesting Date\u201d), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holder of such Company RSU Award, the applicable RSU Consideration with respect to such Company RSU Award or portion thereof (less any applicable withholding Taxes), subject to such holder\u2019s continued employment with the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or its Subsidiaries) through the applicable RSU Vesting Date\u037e provided that, if such holder\u2019s employment terminates prior to the applicable RSU Vesting Date due to termination by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or its Subsidiaries) without Cause, by such holder for Good Reason, or due to the holder\u2019s death or Disability, then subject to such holder\u2019s (or estate\u2019s) execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by the Surviving -16-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCorporation (a \u201cRelease\u201d), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to such holder the applicable RSU Consideration with respect to such Company RSU Award (less any applicable withholding Taxes) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the effective date of such Release (or, if applicable, the applicable Deferred Settlement Date). Any payment in respect of any Company RSU Award that, immediately prior to such cancellation, was treated as \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU Awards if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code (the \u201cDeferred Settlement Date\u201d). \n\n\n3.5 Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law\u037e provided, however, that, except (i) with respect to amounts treated as compensation for Tax purposes or (ii) as a result of the failure of any holder of Company Shares to provide Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8, as applicable, demonstrating that such holder is exempt from withholding, Parent shall provide the Company commercially reasonable notice of any applicable payor\u2019s intention to make such deduction or withholding and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. \n\n\n3.6 Further Actions. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. \n\n\nARTICLE 4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY \n\n\nExcept as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed on or after January 1, 2020 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (other than any disclosures contained under the captions \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d and any other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature but, for the purpose of clarification, including and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any such statements), but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be applicable to Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b) or 4.2(d), or (ii) the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the \u201cCompany Disclosure Letter\u201d) (it being acknowledged and agreed that disclosure in any Section or Subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all -17-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nother sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: \n\n\n4.1 Organization and Qualification\u037e Subsidiaries. \n\n\n(a) The Company is a corporation, duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of Delaware and has requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, except for such failures to have such power that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The notices of redemption delivered to the Trustee and holders of the Company Senior Notes (if delivered prior to Closing) may state that the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any condition to redemption stated therein shall be satisfied or such Redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event such condition shall not have been satisfied. At the Closing, Parent shall make, or cause to be made, a deposit with the Trustee of funds sufficient to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, accrued and unpaid interest through the applicable redemption date on, and applicable make-whole and redemption premiums related to, the Company Senior Notes so redeemed, together with payment of other fees and expenses payable by the Company under the Company Senior Notes Indenture. \n\n\n(iv) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation, at Parent\u2019s sole cost and expense, reasonably requested by Parent in accordance with this Section 6.14(c).

If, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines is necessary (after consultation with the Company and if the Company does not unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering document for the Debt Financing, then, upon the Company\u2019s review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing, unless the Company reasonably objects, the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public information. \n\n\n(g) Parent agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives prior to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement (and thereafter, promptly upon demand and in each case directly to the applicable Company Representative) from and for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses, fees, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, awards and liabilities such Persons may incur in connection with the Debt Financing, any Debt Offer, any Redemption, the Payoff Letter and the performance of their respective obligations under this Section 6.14 and the provision of any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries) (including reasonable and documented costs and expenses of counsel and advisors), except to the extent incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful -67-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nmisconduct of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, and such Subsidiaries and Representatives shall be express third party beneficiaries of this sentence, and Parent\u2019s obligation in this sentence shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. \n\n\n6.15 Financing. \n\n\n(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Required Amount not later than the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Letters (including complying with any valid request requiring the exercise of \u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions in the fee letter associated with the Debt Commitment Letters) (or on other terms with respect to conditionality that are not less favorable to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and otherwise on terms and conditions as would not have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.15(c), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Letters and the Limited Guarantee, (ii) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing)) on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (which may reflect \u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions) (or on other terms with respect to conditionality that are not less favorable to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and otherwise on terms and conditions as would not have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.15(c)) (such definitive agreements, the \u201cDefinitive Financing Agreements\u201d), (iii) satisfy and comply with on a timely basis (except to the extent that Parent and Merger Sub have obtained the waiver of) all conditions and covenants to the funding or investing of the Financing required to pay the Required Amount applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements that are within their control that are to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) consummate the Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount or enforce the Limited Guarantee at or prior to the Closing and (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Letters and the Limited Guarantee. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of any Investor to provide the Equity Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount or to the termination of obligations under the Limited Guarantee. \n\n\n(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.15(c), any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any \u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, notify the Company of such unavailability and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions (including any \u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letters in -68-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nan amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains available and taking into account any available Equity Financing, to pay the Required Amount (\u201cAlternative Financing\u201d) and to obtain and promptly provide the Company with a copy of the new executed commitment letter that provides for such Alternative Financing (and any related executed fee letters, fee credit letter and engagement letters, as applicable, in connection therewith, copies of which shall be provided to the Company (it being understood that any such fee letter, fee credit letter and engagement letter may be redacted as to fee amounts, \u201cflex\u201d terms and other commercially sensitive economic terms customarily redacted, so long as such redactions do not relate to any terms that may adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or termination of the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to pay the Required Amount)) (the \u201cAlternative Financing Commitment Letter\u201d). In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.15(b)) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. For purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub that speak to the date of this Agreement) references to (i) the \u201cFinancing\u201d and \u201cDebt Financing\u201d shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and any such Alternative Financing, (ii) the \u201cFinancing Letters\u201d and the \u201cDebt Commitment Letters\u201d shall include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and any such Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, (iii) the \u201cDefinitive Financing Agreements\u201d shall include the definitive documentation relating to the debt financing completed by the Debt Commitment Letters and any such Alternative Financing and (iv) the \u201cDebt Financing Sources\u201d shall include the financial institutions and other entities party to any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter. \n\n\n(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit or consent to or agree to any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination or other modification or waiver of any provision or remedy under, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of Equity Financing available thereunder), (ii) the Limited Guarantee or (iii) the Debt Commitment Letters, without the prior written consent of the Company, if such amendment, restatement, supplement, termination, modification or waiver would (A) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing or would otherwise adversely change, amend, modify or expand any of the conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing, (B) be reasonably expected to prevent or delay the availability of all or a portion of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) or (D) otherwise adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letters\u037e provided that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, or any amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, modification or supplement to, or replacement of, the Debt Commitment Letters, be deemed to adversely expand the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to assist with respect to the Debt Financing under Section 6.14. \n\n\n(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.15 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letters. \n\n\n(e) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice after Parent\u2019s knowledge (i) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, give rise to any default or breach) by any party under any of the Financing Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of any termination of any of the Financing Letters, (iii) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any Investor or Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement, or any material provision thereof, in each case by any party thereto, or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing or make the funding of the Financing required to pay the Required Amount on the Closing Date less likely to occur or give rise to a right of termination under any such arrangement, and (iv) of the occurrence of an event or development that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to pay the Required Amount. Without limitation of the foregoing, upon the request of the Company from time to time, Parent will promptly update the Company on the material activity and developments of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing, including by providing copies of all definitive agreements (and drafts of all offering documents and marketing materials) related to the Financing, and any amendments, modifications or replacements to any Financing Letters (or any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter). \n\n\n(f) Each of Parent and Merger Subs shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to launch no later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement a Consent Solicitation seeking consents to the waiver of the requirement to repurchase the Company Senior Notes in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the \u201cChange of Control Triggering Event\u201d covenant set forth in the Company Senior Notes Indenture. -70-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.16 Section 338(h)(10) Election.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable will not relieve the Company Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties, respectively, from liability for any fraud or Willful Breach. \n\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any documents executed in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, but subject in all respects to Section 9.17 (including the limitations set forth therein), the maximum aggregate liability, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any payment in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, of Parent Related Parties collectively (including monetary damages for fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise (including Willful Breach), or monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) (i) under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or otherwise, (ii) in connection with the failure of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or (iii) in respect of any representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or otherwise, will not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) (the \u201cMaximum Liability Amount\u201d)\u037e provided, that, in no event shall (A) the aggregate amount of the Parent Termination Fee, if any, due and owing to the -75-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCompany pursuant to Section 8.3(c) together with the aggregate amount of the amounts, if any, due and owing under Section 8.3(d), if any, exceed the sum of the Parent Termination Fee and the Expense Cap (together with the interest described in the last sentence of Section 8.3(d)), which in any event shall not exceed the Maximum Liability Amount, (B) the aggregate amount of Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations with respect to the amounts, if any, due and owing under Section 8.3(d) exceed the Expense Cap, and (C) the Company, its Affiliates or any Company Related Party seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent Related Parties, or compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of, any monetary damages in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount or any of the foregoing limitation (as applicable). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or otherwise, under no circumstances may the Company receive both (A) an award of monetary damages, on the one hand, and (B) any of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any of the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 6.14(g) and Section 8.3(f), on the other hand. \n\n\nARTICLE 9 GENERAL PROVISIONS \n\n\n9.1 Amendment.

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. \n\n\n9.3 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or any rights arising out of any breach of any of the foregoing, shall survive the Effective Time, except that this Section 9.3 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time, which shall survive to the extent expressly provided for herein. -76-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n9.4 Fees and Expenses.

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). \n\n\nSECTION 1.04.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. \n\n\nSECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that references therein to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to Powder Acquisition Corp.), and (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that references therein to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to Powder Acquisition Corp.), in each case, subject to the requirements of Section 6.05 and until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions therein. \n\n\nSECTION 1.06. Directors and Officers. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. \n\n\nARTICLE II \n\n\nEffect on Capital Stock; Payment for Shares \n\n\nSECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (such shares, \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $47.50, without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02. (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d) (such shares, \u201cAppraisal Shares\u201d) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of   3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\ncompetent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under and to be paid such consideration as is determined pursuant to Section 262, shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). If the Surviving Corporation makes any payment after the Effective Time with respect to Appraisal Shares to the holders thereof pursuant to such holders\u2019 appraisal rights under Section 262, then any portion of the Merger Consideration relating to such Appraisal Shares held in the Exchange Fund shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of any such demands or any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to the rights of appraisal of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demand that is not conditioned on consummation of the Merger. \n\n\nSECTION 2.02. Payment of Merger Consideration. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d). (b) Exchange Procedure. Promptly (and in any event no later than three Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, or a non-certificated share or non-certificated shares, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCertificates\u201d or \u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d, respectively) which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) in the case of a Certificate, surrender of such Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or (B) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Paying Agent (or such other   4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nevidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the provisions of this Article II. (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock that such Certificate or Book-Entry Share represented immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. No cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate Book-Entry Share until the surrender of such Certificate Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Section 2.02. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered for Merger Consideration prior to the four (4) year anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No such investment or any loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II. Parent shall take actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash in an amount sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, or, if the undistributed portion of the Exchange Fund has been returned to Parent pursuant to Section 2.02(d), by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration. (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. \n\n\nSECTION 2.03. Equity Awards. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions (including obtaining any required Consents) as may be required to effect the following, effective upon the Effective Time: (i) except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of a Company Vested Stock Option, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any such Company Stock Option that vests as a result of the occurrence of the Merger (a \u201cCompany Vested Stock Option\u201d) shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled, with the holder of such Company Vested Stock Option becoming entitled to receive with respect thereto solely an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (A) (x) the excess of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of such Company Vested   6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nStock Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Vested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) any amount of the option bonus payment that the holder of such Company Stock Option is entitled to receive with respect to such Company Stock Option in connection with the Company\u2019s May 2019 dividend recapitalization transaction that remains unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a non-employee member of the Company Board (whether vested or unvested) (a \u201cDirector RSU\u201d) shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled, with the holder of such Director RSU becoming entitled to receive with respect thereto solely an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Director RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any vesting that would occur as a result of the occurrence of the Merger (a \u201cCompany Unvested Stock Option\u201d), shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled and converted into a stock option award (a \u201cConverted Stock Option Award\u201d) with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such Company Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (x) the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Unvested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) with an exercise price per share that is equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest cent) of (x) the exercise price per share of such Company Unvested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price in this clause (B), the \u201cConverted Exercise Price\u201d). With respect to any fractional share of Parent common stock that would otherwise be included in a Converted Stock Option Award but for the rounding down to the nearest share of Parent common stock as described in the immediately foregoing sentence, the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest cent) of (I) the amount of such fractional share of Parent common stock and (II) the excess of (X) the Parent Stock Price over (Y) the Converted Exercise Price. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d means a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and (2) the denominator of which is the average closing price, rounded down to the nearest cent, per share of Parent common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the consecutive period of ten (10) days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (the average closing price described in this clause (2), the \u201cParent Stock Price\u201d);   7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(iv) each Company RSU that is not a Director RSU and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled and converted into a restricted stock unit award (a \u201cConverted RSU Award\u201d) with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (v) each Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled and converted into a restricted stock unit award (a \u201cConverted PSU Award\u201d) with substantially the same terms and conditions (except that such restricted stock unit award shall no longer be subject to performance-based vesting conditions) as were applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU based, except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter, on the greater of (1) the target level of performance applicable to such Company PSU and (2) the actual level of performance achieved as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined by the Company Board in its reasonable discretion in accordance with the applicable plans and agreements after reasonable prior consultation with Parent. (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue to honor the Company\u2019s Policy on Certain Terminations as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to the Converted Stock Option Awards, Converted RSU Awards and Converted PSU Awards, which, for the avoidance of doubt, provides that, in the event of the termination of employment or services of the holder of a Converted Stock Option Award, Converted RSU Award, or Converted PSU Award, as applicable: (i) by Parent or its Subsidiaries other than for Cause (as defined in the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement thereunder), and other than due to such holder\u2019s Disability (as defined below), within 18 months following the Effective Time, such award shall immediately become fully vested upon such termination; (ii) due to the holder\u2019s death or Disability (as defined in the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement thereunder), in each case, at any time following the Effective Time, such award shall immediately become (x) fully vested upon such termination, in the case of a Converted Stock Option Award or Converted RSU Award, and (y) vested upon such termination with respect to a pro-rata portion thereof (calculated based on the number of days elapsed in the performance period that was previously applicable to such Converted PSU Award prior to such termination), in the case of a Converted PSU Award; or   8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(iii) due to the holder\u2019s Retirement (as defined below), at any time following the Effective Time, (x) such award shall immediately become vested upon such termination with respect to a pro-rata portion thereof (calculated based on the number of days elapsed in the vesting period applicable to such Converted Stock Option Award or Converted RSU Award or the performance period that was previously applicable to such Converted PSU Award, as applicable, prior to such termination), and (y) in the case of a Converted Stock Option, the vested portion thereof shall remain exercisable for one year following such termination (but in no event beyond the expiration of the term of such Converted Stock Option). For purposes hereof, \u201cRetirement\u201d shall mean the termination of a holder\u2019s employment or services (other than for Cause or due to the holder\u2019s death or Disability) following the date on which (1) the holder attains the age of 55 years old and the number of completed years of the holder\u2019s employment or services with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates (and their respective predecessors) is at least 10 or (2) the holder attains the age of 60 years old and the number of completed years of the holder\u2019s employment or services with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates (and their respective predecessors) is at least five. (c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event no later than 10 Business Days) after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in the case of any such amounts that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and may be paid through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or, in the case of non-employee directors, such other method as the Company typically uses for payments to such Persons.

provided, further, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(f) shall be void and of no force and effect unless such termination is in accordance with Section 8.01(f) and the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.06 prior to or concurrently with such termination.  48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(g) (i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 will prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to the Company\u2019s stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and (ii) no disclosure that the Company Board may determine in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the Company is required to make under applicable Law will constitute a violation of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall the Company Board make an Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section 5.02(f). \n\n\nARTICLE VI \n\n\nAdditional Agreements \n\n\nSECTION 6.01.

Any such additional information furnished in connection with the preparation of any filing or submission shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications and strategy for making filings under and obtaining any Authorizations or Consents with respect to any Antitrust Laws, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, and for dealing with the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental Entity with respect to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law, and Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead the defense strategy for dealing with any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

Parent shall pay all filing fees required under the HSR Act or such other Antitrust Law by the Company and Parent. The parties may, as they deem advisable, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.03(d) or any other section of this Agreement as \u201coutside counsel only.\u201d Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall require Parent or any of its affiliates to propose, negotiate, effect, agree to or commit to, or execute any settlements, undertakings (affirmative or otherwise), consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or any other Person obligating Parent or any of its affiliates to: (i) sell, divest, license or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset (whether tangible or intangible) or business of Parent or its affiliates or terminate any existing relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent or its affiliates, (ii) sell, divest, license or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset (whether tangible or intangible) or business of the Company or its affiliates or terminate any existing relationship, contractual right or obligation of Company or its affiliates, (iii) create any relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates, or (iv) implement any limitations, prohibitions or restrictions affecting the business, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates or on the ability of Parent or its affiliates to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any Equity Interests in the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (including the right to vote such Equity Interests) or to control the business, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (each of the actions in the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a \u201cRemedial Action\u201d), other than a Permitted Remedial Action (which Parent shall effect if necessary to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter); provided, that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates shall only be required to agree to any Permitted Remedial Action if and to the extent ultimately necessary to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. A \u201cPermitted Remedial Action\u201d shall mean (a) a Remedial Action of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof that, individually and in the aggregate with all other such Remedial Actions, involves assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that, in the aggregate, generated no more than 10% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and (b) proposals, agreements, commitments or undertakings from Parent to supply and provide Parent\u2019s products and services on commercially reasonable terms to the Company\u2019s competitors, consistent with past practice, provided that such proposals, agreements, commitments or undertakings, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a substantial impact on the benefits   54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nthat Parent reasonably expects it and its Subsidiaries to derive from the Transactions. The Company shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to propose, negotiate, effect, agree to or commit to, or execute any settlements, undertakings (affirmative or otherwise), consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or any other Person obligating Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to take or commit to take any Remedial Action without the prior written consent of Parent. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations pursuant to this Section 6.03 unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to defend, litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding brought by or against any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any Authorization or Consent from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. (e) In addition to and without limiting any of the parties\u2019 respective obligations in this Section 6.03, each of the Company, the Company Board, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action, including granting such approvals, necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute, \u201cbusiness combination\u201d, \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d, \u201cfair price\u201d, \u201cmoratorium\u201d or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute, \u201cbusiness combination\u201d, \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d, \u201cfair price\u201d, \u201cmoratorium\u201d or similar Law becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement. (f) The parties shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, enter into any merger, acquisition or similar transaction, or any agreement to effect any such transaction, for any business that competes directly and materially with the other party\u2019s business, that will make it materially more difficult, or materially increase the time required, to (i) obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (ii) avoid a Legal Restraint. \n\n\nSECTION 6.04. Continuing Employee Matters. (a) For the period from the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective Time each employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company who remains in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, a \u201cContinuing Employee\u201d) shall receive (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and incentive compensation opportunities (other than equity incentive compensation opportunities, which instead will be consistent with the opportunities applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent and Subsidiaries of Parent) that, in each case, are not less favorable than as provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) severance (based on severance arrangements as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, post-employment health and welfare benefits, equity-based compensation and change of control, retention or other one-off awards) that are not less favorable in the aggregate to those that were provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that, with respect to any Continuing Employee who is primarily based outside of the United States, the requirements of this Section 6.04(a) shall be subject to any requirements under applicable Law.   55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause any plans, programs, agreements or arrangements established or maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) (the \u201cNew Plans\u201d) to recognize each Continuing Employee\u2019s service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any predecessor of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (to the extent such service is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary), for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized (i) for any purpose under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare plan, (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits, (iii) for purposes of any New Plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (iv) for purposes of any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. (c) With respect to any New Plan that is a welfare plan, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. (d) If requested by Parent not less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as necessary to terminate the Company Benefit Plans that are United States Tax-qualified defined contribution plans (the \u201cCompany DC Plans\u201d), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions and other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to reasonable review and comment of Parent. If Parent requests that any Company DC Plan be terminated, the applicable Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries (each such plan, a \u201cParent DC Plan\u201d), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan for such Continuing Employees. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company DC Plans to the participants, Parent shall take any action necessary to permit the Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions of \u201celigible rollover distributions\u201d from the applicable Company DC Plan to the applicable Parent DC Plan (including in cash or notes (in the case of loans)).   56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the Company Benefit Plans (including any change in control severance agreement or other arrangement that is a Company Benefit Plan), in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), it being understood that the foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to amend any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan containing a definition of \u201cchange in control\u201d or \u201cchange of control\u201d (or similar term), the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d or \u201cchange of control\u201d (or applicable term). (f) If Closing occurs prior to December 31, 2021, with respect to each cash incentive bonus program of the Company and its Subsidiaries with a performance period that is in-cycle as of the Closing (each, a \u201cCompany Bonus Program\u201d), following the Closing, (i) payments pursuant such Company Bonus Program with respect to such performance period shall be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and calculated excluding any merger-related transaction costs, and (ii) Parent shall not make any modification to such Company Bonus Program with respect to such performance period in a manner that is detrimental to any participant therein. (g) Parent and the Company agree to the additional items set forth on Section 6.04(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter. (h) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, this Section 6.04 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.04, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever (including any right to continued employment by or services with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries) under or by reason of this Section 6.04. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings or to continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose.   57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSECTION 6.05. Indemnification. (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to, (i) assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former director or officer (the \u201cIndemnified Persons\u201d) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as provided in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof and, in the case of any indemnification agreement, as set forth in Section 6.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and of which the Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies), without further action, as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and (ii) during the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with the defense of any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnified Person was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person in the Indemnified Person\u2019s capacity as a director, officer or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law that the Surviving Corporation could provide such indemnification to such Indemnified Persons pursuant to the DGCL, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable rights of indemnification and exculpation contemplated by this Section 6.05 and pursuant to the terms of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect at or immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be impaired by any modification of such terms in any amendment or restatement of such Company Charter or Company Bylaws following the Effective Time (including in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Merger). None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 6.05 (each, a \u201cClaim\u201d) for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. (b) Parent shall obtain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain in consultation with the Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid (or \u201ctail\u201d) directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the   58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCompany\u2019s or any of its Subsidiary\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies, with coverage for six years following the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to the insureds than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) an amount in excess of 450% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for such insurance for its current fiscal year; provided, further, that, if the amount necessary to procure such prepaid (or \u201ctail\u201d) insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such maximum amount. Parent shall cause the \u201ctail\u201d policy delivered in accordance with the preceding sentence to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 6.05(b). (c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent\u2019s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall, release, waive or impair any rights to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.05 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. The Indemnified Persons shall be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.05. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, Parent agrees that any indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance available to any Indemnified Person who at or prior to the Closing was a director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be secondary to the indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance to be provided by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.05 and that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (i) shall be the primary indemnitors of first resort for the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 6.05, (ii) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities with respect to Indemnified Persons that are addressed by this Section 6.05 and (iii) shall not make any claim for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any other indemnification or insurance available to any Indemnified Person with respect to any matter addressed by this Section 6.05   59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSECTION 6.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.17 and this Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger and the other Transactions are consummated. (b) In the event that: (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); (ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or (iii) a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) is made, proposed or communicated to the Company Board, any committee of the Company Board or management of the Company, or is publicly made, proposed or communicated publicly, or any Person or group publicly proposes or announces an intention to make a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn), and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(g) and (B) within 12 months of such termination (1) any transaction included within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or (2) the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of any transaction within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal, in each case whether or not involving the same Company Takeover Proposal or the Person or group making the Company Takeover Proposal referred to in this Section 6.06(b)(iii); provided that for purposes of clause (B), the term \u201cCompany Takeover Proposal\u201d shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.03, except that all references to \u201c20%\u201d in such definition shall be deemed references to \u201c50.1%\u201d, \n\n\nthen the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee of $520,354,225 (the \u201cCompany Termination Fee\u201d). Any fee due under this Section 6.06(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within three Business Days after the date of such termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of this clause (iii), within three Business Days after the earlier of (x) the date of the consummation of the transaction referred to in clause (B)(1) thereof and (y) the date of entry into the definitive agreement referred to in clause (B)(2) thereof.
